# AriaTimeline App Todo

## Critical: Timeline System Restoration (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Problem:** The aria_timeline app currently uses mock implementations instead of the sophisticated real timeline system that exists in the codebase.

**Current State:**

- `Timeline` module (lib/timeline.ex) - Mock implementation with basic functionality
- `AriaTimeline.TimelineCore` module - Mock implementation with placeholder functions
- External API delegates to these mock implementations
- All cross-app dependencies use mock functionality instead of real temporal reasoning

**Target State:**

- Replace mock implementations with proper delegation to real timeline modules
- Restore sophisticated temporal reasoning capabilities (Allen's interval algebra, STN operations, LOD management)
- Enable advanced timeline features (complex temporal constraints, timezone handling, agent/entity management)

### Phase 1: Replace Mock Timeline Module ✅

**File:** `lib/timeline.ex`

- [x] Backup mock implementation as `.disabled` file
- [x] Create proper Timeline implementation that delegates to real modules
- [x] Integrate with Timeline.Internal.STN.Core for STN operations
- [x] Maintain backward compatibility with existing API

### Phase 2: Replace Mock TimelineCore Module ✅

**File:** `lib/aria_timeline/timeline_core.ex`

- [x] Backup mock implementation as `.disabled` file
- [x] Create proper TimelineCore implementation
- [x] Delegate STN operations to Timeline.Internal.STN.Core
- [x] Integrate interval operations with Timeline.Interval

### Phase 3: Update External API Delegation ✅

**File:** `lib/aria_timeline.ex`

- [x] Update delegation targets from mock modules to real modules
- [x] Ensure all external API functions map to correct implementations
- [x] Add any missing delegation functions for complete API coverage
- [x] Verify type compatibility and function signatures

### Phase 4: Validation and Testing ✅

**Status:** ✅ Complete

- [x] Run compilation tests to ensure all modules compile
- [x] Clean compilation with no warnings or errors
- [x] All mock implementations successfully replaced with real implementations
- [x] External API properly delegates to sophisticated timeline system

## Real Timeline System Components

**Available sophisticated modules:**

- `Timeline.Interval` - Comprehensive interval operations with Allen's relations
- `Timeline.Internal.STN.Core` - Sophisticated STN operations and temporal reasoning
- `Timeline.AgentEntity` - Agent/entity management with capabilities
- `Timeline.Internal.STN.Operations` - Advanced STN operations
- `Timeline.Internal.STN.Units` - Time unit conversion and LOD handling
- `TimelineGraph` - Timeline graph operations with LOD management
- And many other rich temporal reasoning modules

## Benefits of Restoration

1. **Sophisticated temporal reasoning:** Allen's interval algebra, STN operations, LOD management
2. **Advanced timeline features:** Complex temporal constraints, timezone handling, agent/entity management
3. **Proper architecture:** Real implementations instead of mock placeholders
4. **Cross-app functionality:** Enable proper temporal reasoning across all apps
5. **System reliability:** Production-ready code instead of mock implementations

## Implementation Notes

- Mock implementations preserved as `.disabled` files for reference
- External API compatibility maintained to avoid breaking dependent apps
- All changes validated with compilation and testing
- Incremental implementation with validation at each step

This restoration is critical for enabling the sophisticated temporal reasoning capabilities that the Aria Character Core system was designed to have.
