## Context

The temporal planner implementation roadmap has been spread across multiple ADRs (034, 037, 038, 039, 041, 042, 046, 047, 048, 049, 050, 071), making it difficult to track the complete implementation scope. This ADR consolidates all temporal planner tasks from existing ADRs into a single, ordered GitHub issues task list suitable for project management.

This consolidation merges tasks from:

- R25W017DEAF: Definitive Temporal Planner Architecture (foundational architecture)
- ADR-042: Temporal Planner Cold Boot Implementation Order (superseded but contains detailed tasks)
- ADR-046: User-Friendly Temporal Constraint Specification (API design)
- ADR-047: TimeStrike Temporal Planner Test Scenario (test scenarios)
- ADR-048: Developer-Friendly APIs for Temporal Planner Implementation (tooling)
- ADR-049: Enhanced Temporal Planner Implementation with Unified APIs (current direction)
- ADR-050: Temporal Planner Cold Boot from Current Codebase (realistic implementation)
