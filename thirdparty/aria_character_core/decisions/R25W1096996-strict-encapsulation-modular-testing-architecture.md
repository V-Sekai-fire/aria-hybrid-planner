# R25W1096996: Strict Encapsulation and Modular Testing Architecture

<!-- @adr_serial R25W1096996 -->

**Status:** Active (Paused)  
**Date:** 2025-06-23  
**Priority:** HIGH

## Context

Breakthrough insight identified: real coding style problem requires strict encapsulation and modularity. Every logical "library" must be actual library in mono-repo, each separately tested with unit tests that never become integration tests.

Current state shows mixed encapsulation:

- Some apps extracted: `ast_migrate`, `elixir_png`, `png_generator`, `aria_security`
- Major lib/ modules remain: `aria_auth`, `aria_engine`, `aria_storage`, `aria_town`
- Testing boundaries unclear between modules
- Integration tests masquerading as unit tests

**Recent Progress:**

- âœ… `aria_security` successfully extracted (2025-06-23)
- âœ… `aria_storage` successfully extracted (2025-06-23)
- âœ… `aria_auth` successfully extracted (2025-06-23)
- âœ… `aria_town` successfully extracted (2025-06-23)
- ðŸ”„ Next target: `aria_engine` (complex, requires subdomain splitting)

## The Strict Encapsulation Principle

### Core Rule

Every logical library = actual Elixir app in umbrella project with:

- Independent test suite
- Clear API boundaries  
- Isolated dependencies
- Single responsibility

### Library Boundary Criteria

Extract when module has:

- **Distinct domain responsibility**
- **Independent testing requirements**
- **Reusable functionality**
- **Clear input/output contracts**
- **Minimal coupling to other domains**

### Testing Isolation Requirements

- **Unit tests**: Test only internal library logic
- **No external dependencies**: Mock all external calls
- **Fast execution**: Sub-second test suites
- **Independent**: Can run without other libraries

## Layered Testing Architecture

### Beautiful Testing Pattern

Each layer's unit tests naturally become integration tests for layer below:

```
Layer N:   Unit Tests (test Layer N logic)
           â†“ (become integration tests for Layer N-1)
Layer N-1: Unit Tests (test Layer N-1 logic)  
           â†“ (become integration tests for Layer N-2)
Layer N-2: Unit Tests (test Layer N-2 logic)
```

### Testing Hierarchy

- **Library Unit Tests**: Internal logic only
- **Library Integration Tests**: API contracts between libraries
- **System Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflows
- **Acceptance Tests**: User-facing functionality

## Connections to Established Knowledge

### Software Engineering Principles

**SOLID Principles:**

- **Single Responsibility**: Each library has one clear domain
- **Dependency Inversion**: Libraries depend on abstractions, not implementations
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean, focused APIs between boundaries

**Architectural Patterns:**

- **Clean Architecture**: Strict dependency rules, layers depend only inward
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Each library as hexagon with ports/adapters
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Libraries represent bounded contexts
- **Microservices Principles**: Applied at library level within monorepo

### Testing Patterns

**Test Pyramid**: Unit tests at library level, integration between libraries
**Testing Trophy**: Emphasis on integration testing emerging from layered approach
**Contract Testing**: API boundaries verified between libraries
**Isolated Unit Testing**: No external dependencies in unit tests

### Elixir/OTP Specific

**Umbrella Projects**: Natural Elixir way to achieve modular architecture
**OTP Design Principles**: Each app as supervision tree with clear boundaries
**GenServer Isolation**: Process boundaries mirror library boundaries
**Application Boundaries**: Clear start/stop semantics per library

## AST Migration Tool Integration

### Using ast_migrate for Testing Architecture

The `ast_migrate` app provides powerful AST-based transformations to systematically improve code quality and fix testing issues across all extracted apps.

**For detailed information about the AST migration tool, see:** `apps/ast_migrate/decisions/001-git-style-ast-migration-tool.md`

#### Available AST Migration Commands

**Basic Migration:**

```bash
# From the ast_migrate directory
mix ast.simple --rule unit_test_improvements --target /path/to/app
```

**Git-Integrated Migration:**

```bash
mix ast.commit --rule unit_test_improvements --target /path/to/app
```

#### Key Transformation Rules

**1. Unit Test Improvements Rule**

- Extracts intermediate variables in assertions for better readability
- Adds missing assertions to bare function calls
- Improves test structure and debugging capabilities

**2. Namespace Reference Fixes (Custom Rule)**

- Systematically updates module references after app extraction
- Fixes `AriaEngine.Timeline` â†’ `Timeline` namespace issues
- Resolves import statement conflicts

**3. Test Isolation Improvements (Custom Rule)**

- Identifies and removes cross-app dependencies in tests
- Converts integration tests to proper unit tests
- Adds mocking for external dependencies

#### Integration with Testing Workflow

**Phase 5a: Systematic Test Fixes**

```bash
# Fix namespace issues across all apps
for app in apps/*/; do
  cd apps/ast_migrate
  mix ast.simple --rule namespace_fixes --target "../../$app"
done

# Apply unit test improvements
for app in apps/*/; do
  cd apps/ast_migrate
  mix ast.simple --rule unit_test_improvements --target "../../$app"
done
```

**Phase 5b: Contract Test Generation**

```bash
# Generate contract test templates
mix ast.simple --rule contract_test_generator --target ../../apps/aria_temporal_planner
```

**Phase 5c: Test Isolation Validation**

```bash
# Identify and fix cross-app test dependencies
mix ast.simple --rule test_isolation_checker --target ../../apps/aria_hybrid_planner
```

#### Benefits of AST Migration Approach

- **Systematic**: Applies transformations consistently across all apps
- **Safe**: Git integration provides rollback capabilities
- **Trackable**: Each transformation creates a commit with detailed history
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new rules for project-specific patterns
- **Precise**: AST-level transformations avoid regex-based errors

## Implementation Strategy

### Library Extraction Workflow

Each library extraction follows this complete process:

1. **Create New App Structure**
   - Generate `apps/[library_name]/` directory
   - Create `mix.exs` with proper dependencies
   - Set up standard Elixir app structure

2. **Copy Source Code**
   - Move all files from `lib/[library]/` to `apps/[library]/lib/`
   - Preserve directory structure and file organization
   - Maintain existing module namespaces

3. **Migrate Test Suite**
   - Move all files from `test/[library]/` to `apps/[library]/test/`
   - Update test helper and configuration files
   - Ensure test isolation and independence

4. **Configure Dependencies**
   - Update umbrella `mix.exs` to include new app in applications list
   - Configure new app dependencies using umbrella path pattern:

     ```elixir
     defp deps do
       [
         {:aria_security, path: "../aria_security"},
         {:aria_storage, path: "../aria_storage"},
         # external deps...
       ]
     end
     ```

   - Resolve any circular dependency issues

5. **Verify Independent Operation**
   - Run isolated test suite: `cd apps/[library] && mix test`
   - Confirm all tests pass without external dependencies
   - Validate compilation and functionality

6. **Update Import References**
   - Find all imports of moved modules throughout codebase
   - Update import statements to reference new app location
   - Fix any broken module references

7. **Remove Original Code**
   - Delete `lib/[library]/` directory completely
   - Delete `test/[library]/` directory completely
   - Ensure no duplicate code remains

8. **Create Migration Tombstone**
   - Create `lib/[library].tombstone.md` file documenting extraction
   - Include extraction date, new location, and ADR reference
   - Example format:

     ```markdown
     # [Library] Migration Tombstone
     
     **Extracted:** 2025-06-23  
     **New Location:** `apps/[library]/`  
     **ADR Reference:** R25W1096996 Strict Encapsulation
     
     This module was extracted to maintain strict encapsulation boundaries.
     All functionality now available in the dedicated umbrella app.
     ```

9. **Final Verification**
   - Run full umbrella test suite
   - Confirm no broken references or missing modules
   - Validate all functionality preserved

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Clear Boundaries**: Explicit separation between domains
- **Better Testing**: True unit tests with clear integration boundaries
