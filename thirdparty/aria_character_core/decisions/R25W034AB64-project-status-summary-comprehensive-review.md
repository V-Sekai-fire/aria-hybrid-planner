## Context

This ADR provides a comprehensive status summary of the Aria Character Core project as of R25W034AB64, cross-referencing all existing ADRs against the current codebase to identify completed implementations, ongoing work, and abandoned decisions. This summary serves as a definitive checkpoint for future development planning.

The project has evolved significantly from its initial conception, with multiple architectural decisions, implementation attempts, and strategic pivots documented across 70+ ADRs. A comprehensive status review is necessary to establish the current state and guide future development priorities.

## Current Status Assessment

### ✅ Solidly Implemented

1. **Test-Driven Development Process** - Active and enforcing quality
2. **Multi-Application Architecture** - Clean separation of concerns
3. **Core Infrastructure** - Basic applications functional
4. **Security Integration** - OpenBao integration working
5. **Temporal Planning Foundation** - Architecture and test problems defined

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented / In Progress

1. **Temporal Planner Core Logic** - Specification complete, implementation ongoing
2. **Web Interface Systems** - Multiple approaches, unclear current status
3. **MCP Integration** - Framework established, full integration pending
4. **Workflow Migration** - Flow/Membrane transition partially complete
5. **Real-Time Systems** - Architecture defined, implementation incomplete

### ❌ Explicitly Abandoned/Rejected

1. **Aria TUI Application** - Completely removed (ADR-068)
2. **Lottie Animation Server** - Rejected for complexity (ADR-067)

### 🔄 Superseded/Evolved

1. **ADR-042** Superseded by **ADR-049** - Enhanced temporal planner approach
2. **Membrane Processing** Superseded by **Flow** - Architecture migration

## Technical Debt and Architecture Concerns

### Identified Issues

1. **Multiple Web Interface Approaches** - Need consolidation and clear direction
2. **Temporal Planner Implementation Gap** - Specification complete but core logic pending
3. **Workflow System Migration** - Partial migration state may cause confusion
4. **Documentation-Implementation Alignment** - Some ADRs may be ahead of implementation

### Risk Areas

1. **Temporal Planner Complexity** - R25W0183367 specification is comprehensive but demanding
2. **Performance Requirements** - Real-time constraints across multiple systems
3. **Integration Complexity** - Multiple external systems (Discord, MCP, OpenBao)

## Recommendations for Future Development

### Immediate Priorities (Based on ADR Analysis)

1. **Complete Temporal Planner Implementation** - Focus on ADR-049 enhanced approach
2. **Validate R25W0183367 Canonical Problem** - Ensure Maya's scenario passes completely  
3. **Consolidate Web Interface Strategy** - Choose single approach and implement
4. **Complete Workflow Migration** - Finish Flow/Queue consolidation per ADR-066

### Strategic Alignment

- Continue Test-Driven Development approach (R25W0101F54)
- Maintain TimeStrike game focus (ADR-031)
- Prioritize MVP criteria achievement (R25W012424D)
- Ensure architectural consistency with established decisions

## Success Criteria

This comprehensive status review establishes the baseline for all future development decisions and serves as the definitive reference for the current state of the Aria Character Core project as of June 2025.
