# R25W030C3AA: Aria Queue Functional Implementation

<!-- @adr_serial R25W030C3AA -->

## Status

Paused (Started: June 15, 2025, Paused: June 15, 2025)  
**Priority**: High - prerequisite for aria_engine and aria_timestrike  
**Paused Reason**: Prerequisite aria_flow functionality needs to be implemented first (R25W031D2CC)

## Context

The aria_queue application is a core component that provides background job processing for the Aria platform. Currently, it has several implementation gaps that prevent it from being fully functional:

1. **Disabled Tests**: The main test suite (`jobs_test.exs`) is disabled, indicating known issues
2. **Missing Test Coverage**: Basic tests are empty, providing no validation of functionality
3. **Incomplete Flow Integration**: The Flow-based processing system may not be fully implemented
4. **Dependency Issues**: The system may have missing dependencies or configuration problems

This is blocking progress on aria_engine and aria_timestrike, which depend on aria_queue functionality.

### Current State Analysis

From examination of the codebase:

- **Core API exists**: The main AriaQueue module has a clean API surface
- **Jobs module implemented**: Basic job management functions are present
- **Worker modules exist**: Several worker types are implemented
- **Flow adapter present**: ObanAdapter provides Flow-based processing
- **Tests disabled**: Main test suite is explicitly disabled

### Root Cause

The aria_queue appears to have been partially implemented but tests were disabled due to functionality gaps. The Flow-based system needs to be completed and validated.

## Decision

Implement aria_queue as a fully functional background job processing system that provides:

1. **Working job enqueuing and processing**
2. **Functional Flow-based processing pipelines**
3. **Complete test coverage with passing tests**
4. **Proper integration with the broader Aria ecosystem**

### Implementation Philosophy

- **Flow-first approach**: Use Flow pipelines for efficient job processing
- **Oban compatibility**: Maintain familiar API for existing code
- **Test-driven completion**: Enable and fix tests to validate functionality
- **Minimal dependencies**: Keep the system lightweight and focused

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure

- [ ] Enable disabled tests by renaming `jobs_test.exs.disabled` to `jobs_test.exs`
- [ ] Run tests to identify specific failures
- [ ] Create comprehensive test coverage for core functionality
- [ ] Add integration tests for Flow pipeline processing

### Phase 2: Core Functionality

- [ ] Fix job enqueuing and processing
- [ ] Implement missing Flow pipeline components
- [ ] Ensure worker modules are properly integrated
- [ ] Add error handling and retry logic

### Phase 3: Oban Adapter

- [ ] Complete the ObanAdapter implementation
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with existing Oban-style code
- [ ] Add job status tracking and monitoring
- [ ] Implement job cancellation and retry mechanisms

### Phase 4: Integration Support

- [ ] Ensure proper integration with AriaData for persistence
- [ ] Add configuration for different queue types
- [ ] Implement distributed processing capabilities
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics

### Phase 5: Validation and Documentation

- [ ] Run full test suite with all tests passing
- [ ] Performance validation under load
- [ ] Update documentation and examples
- [ ] Create integration guides for other components

## Success Criteria

1. **All tests pass**: Complete test suite runs successfully
2. **Core functionality works**: Jobs can be enqueued, processed, and completed
3. **Flow integration functional**: Background processing uses Flow pipelines
4. **Clean API surface**: Other components can easily integrate with aria_queue
5. **Performance meets requirements**: Efficient job processing with minimal overhead
6. **Proper error handling**: Failed jobs are retried and error states are managed

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Unblocks dependent components**: aria_engine and aria_timestrike can proceed
- **Provides robust job processing**: Reliable background job system for the platform
- **Flow-based efficiency**: Superior performance compared to database-backed systems
- **Familiar API**: Existing Oban-style code works without changes

### Risks

- **Flow complexity**: Flow-based processing may be complex to debug
- **Integration challenges**: Ensuring proper integration with other components
- **Performance tuning**: May need optimization for specific workloads
