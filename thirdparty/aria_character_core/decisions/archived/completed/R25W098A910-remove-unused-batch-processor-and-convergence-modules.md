## Tombstone Summary

**Original Status:** Completed (June 22, 2025)

**What Was Accomplished:**
- Removed unused `lib/aria_engine/batch_processor.ex` and `lib/aria_engine/convergence.ex` modules
- Cleaned up all cross-references and dependencies
- Replaced modules with tombstone documentation explaining removal rationale
- Verified compilation and test suite success after removal
- Reduced codebase maintenance overhead by eliminating non-functional placeholder code

**Archive Reason:** Work successfully completed - all cleanup phases finished and codebase cruft eliminated.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Removed placeholder modules that only raised "not implemented" errors
- Updated test helpers and documentation to remove convergence terminology
- Created tombstone documentation for future developers
- Verified no remaining references in codebase
- Achieved cleaner, more maintainable codebase
