# R25W07431E8: Project Segment Closure - Temporal Planning Infrastructure

<!-- @adr_serial R25W07431E8 -->

**Status:** Completed  
**Date:** 2025-06-21  
**Priority:** HIGH - Segment closure and transition

## Context

This ADR documents the completion of the temporal planning infrastructure segment. The project has achieved substantial progress in temporal planning, scheduling, and validation capabilities with a robust, tested architecture.

## Decision

Close out the temporal planning infrastructure segment by documenting completed achievements and archiving finished work.

## Completed Achievements

### ✅ Core Temporal Planning Infrastructure

**HybridCoordinatorV2 Implementation:**

- 6 sophisticated planning strategies (Basic, Temporal, Backtracking, Function-as-Object, Hybrid, Advanced)
- Complete temporal reasoning with STN (Simple Temporal Networks) validation
- Advanced error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Comprehensive logging and telemetry integration

**AriaEngine.Scheduler:**

- Full entity/resource scheduling with Critical Path Method (CPM)
- Resource conflict detection and analysis
- Circular dependency identification
- Empty activity list handling with valid empty schedules
- Integration with all HybridCoordinatorV2 strategies

### ✅ Testing and Validation Framework

**Scaling Problem Generator (R25W073B8D1):**

- Cryptographic randomization for true random scaling (1-6 activities)
- Perfect distribution across all activity counts
- Identity case validation for single-activity problems
- Dependency chain validation for multi-activity scenarios
- Performance benchmarks (0.01ms average generation time)

**Comprehensive Test Coverage:**

- 117 Architecture Decision Records documenting all major decisions
- Core functionality tested across all planning strategies
- Robust validation framework for scheduling scenarios
- Complete membrane pipeline testing (15 tests, 0 failures)
- Full test suite: 382 tests, 0 failures (26 doctests, 12 properties)

### ✅ Critical Integration Fixes

**PlannerAdapter Integration (R25W0722F06):**

- Fixed critical routing issue where plan_tasks() was using old Plan.plan() instead of HybridCoordinatorV2
- Restored sophisticated planning capabilities to the system
- Comprehensive logging integration for debugging and monitoring
- All 6 planning strategies now accessible through adapter layer

### ✅ Schedule Samples Framework

**3 Core Demonstration Samples:**

- **Sequential**: Basic sequential activity scheduling
- **ResourceConstraints**: Resource conflict detection for locations, props, character availability
- **EntityCapabilities**: Entity-based scheduling with character-specific abilities and limitations

## Architecture Summary

### Current Production Flow

```
Application → AriaEngine.Scheduler → HybridCoordinatorV2 → Temporal Plan
```

**Key Components:**

1. **Scheduler Layer**: Entity/resource management and CPM analysis
2. **Planning Layer**: HybridCoordinatorV2 with 6 sophisticated strategies
3. **Validation Layer**: STN temporal constraint validation
