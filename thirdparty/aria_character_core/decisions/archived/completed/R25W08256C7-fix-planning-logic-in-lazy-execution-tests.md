# R25W08256C7: Fix Planning Logic in Lazy Execution Tests

<!-- @adr_serial R25W08256C7 -->

**Status:** Completed  
**Date:** June 21, 2025  
**Implementation Start:** June 22, 2025  
**Completion Date:** June 22, 2025  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Phase:** Completed

## Context

**Extracted from R25W081EBFA** - Following successful completion of Timeline doctests and major test suite improvements, 4 remaining test failures in `lazy_execution_test.exs` require focused investigation and resolution.

### Current Test Failures

All 4 failures occur in `test/aria_engine/plan/lazy_execution_test.exs` and relate to planning logic issues:

1. **Plan.Execution.run_lazy_refineahead/4 - Basic Functionality** (line 25)
   - Error: `{:error, "No complete solution found"}`
   - Expected: Successful planning with valid solution tree

2. **Plan.Execution.run_lazy_refineahead/4 - Failure Handling** (line 89)  
   - Error: `{:error, "No complete solution found"}`
   - Expected: Planning to succeed for replanning scenario

3. **Plan.Execution.run_lazy_refineahead/4 - Integration with LazyExecutionStrategy** (line 191)
   - Error: `{:error, "No complete solution found"}`
   - Expected: Strategy integration to work with valid plans

4. **Plan.Execution.run_lazy_refineahead/4 - Refinement-Ahead Logic** (line 142)
   - Error: `{:error, "No alternative methods available for replanning"}`
   - Expected: Successful execution with lookahead depth limits

### Root Cause Analysis

**Key Insight**: All failures stem from `Core.plan(domain, initial_state, todos)` returning error responses instead of valid solution trees. This suggests issues with:

- **Domain setup**: Test helper functions may not create valid planning domains
- **Goal definitions**: Test scenarios may have unsolvable or malformed goals  
- **Planning logic**: Core planning algorithm may have regressions
- **Test data**: Initial states or task definitions may be invalid

## Decision

**Implement systematic investigation and fixes for planning logic issues in lazy execution tests** to achieve 0 test failures and complete the test suite health restoration started in R25W081EBFA.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Diagnostic Investigation (PRIORITY: HIGH)

**Step 1A: Analyze Test Domain Setup**

- [ ] Examine `create_test_domain/0` helper function in lazy_execution_test.exs
- [ ] Verify domain has valid actions, methods, and goal handlers
- [ ] Check that domain creation uses correct `AriaEngine.Domain.Core.new()` syntax
- [ ] Validate domain structure matches expected planning requirements

**Step 1B: Analyze Test Scenarios**

- [ ] Review initial state setup in each failing test
- [ ] Verify goal definitions are valid and achievable
- [ ] Check task definitions (`todos`) for correct format
- [ ] Ensure test scenarios have logical solutions

**Step 1C: Test Core Planning Logic**

- [ ] Create minimal test case to isolate `Core.plan/4` behavior
- [ ] Verify `AriaEngine.Plan.Core.plan/4` works with simple domain
- [ ] Check if issue is in planning algorithm or test setup
- [ ] Validate that planning logic hasn't regressed

### Phase 2: Fix Domain and Test Setup (PRIORITY: HIGH)

**Step 2A: Fix Domain Creation**

- [ ] Update domain helper functions to use correct namespace
- [ ] Ensure domain has all required components (actions, methods, goals)
- [ ] Add validation to confirm domain is properly constructed
- [ ] Test domain creation independently

**Step 2B: Fix Test Scenarios**

- [ ] Review and fix initial state definitions
- [ ] Ensure goals are achievable with available actions
- [ ] Validate task definitions match domain capabilities
- [ ] Add debugging output to understand planning failures

**Step 2C: Fix Planning Integration**

- [ ] Verify `Core.plan/4` calls use correct parameters
- [ ] Check return value handling for both success and error cases
- [ ] Ensure proper error propagation and handling
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging for planning process

### Phase 3: Fix Replanning Logic (PRIORITY: MEDIUM)

**Step 3A: Investigate Replanning Failures**

- [ ] Analyze "No alternative methods available" error in test 4
- [ ] Check replanning logic in `run_lazy_refineahead/4`
- [ ] Verify alternative method discovery and selection
- [ ] Ensure proper fallback handling

**Step 3B: Fix Execution Strategy Integration**

- [ ] Investigate LazyExecutionStrategy integration issues
- [ ] Verify strategy interface compatibility
- [ ] Check that execution strategy can handle solution trees
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling in strategy execution

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Validation (PRIORITY: HIGH)

**Step 4A: Test Individual Components**

- [ ] Run isolated tests for domain creation
- [ ] Test planning logic with known-good scenarios
- [ ] Verify execution logic with valid solution trees
- [ ] Check replanning with controlled failure scenarios

**Step 4B: Integration Testing**

- [ ] Run all lazy_execution_test.exs tests
- [ ] Verify 0 failures in target test file
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- [ ] Confirm overall test health improvement

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 4 tests in `lazy_execution_test.exs` pass successfully
- [ ] `Core.plan/4` returns valid solution trees for test scenarios
- [ ] Replanning logic handles alternative methods correctly
- [ ] LazyExecutionStrategy integration works properly
- [ ] No regressions in other test files
- [ ] Overall test suite achieves 0 failures

## Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Immediate Diagnostic (CURRENT FOCUS)

1. **Examine test file structure** - Understand how tests are organized and what they expect
2. **Analyze domain creation** - Verify test helper functions create valid domains
3. **Check planning calls** - Ensure `Core.plan/4` is called with correct parameters
4. **Add debugging output** - Insert logging to understand where planning fails

### Step 2: Systematic Fixes

1. **Fix domain setup** - Ensure test domains have all required components
2. **Fix test scenarios** - Make sure goals are achievable and well-formed
3. **Fix planning integration** - Correct any parameter or return value issues
4. **Test incrementally** - Verify each fix before proceeding

### Step 3: Validation and Completion

1. **Run target tests** - Confirm all 4 failures are resolved
2. **Run full test suite** - Ensure no regressions introduced
3. **Document findings** - Record root causes and solutions for future reference

## Risks and Mitigation

**Risk:** Planning logic regressions affecting other parts of system
**Mitigation:** Focus on test-specific issues first, validate core planning separately

**Risk:** Complex interdependencies between planning components
**Mitigation:** Use systematic approach, fix one component at a time

**Risk:** Test scenarios may be fundamentally flawed
**Mitigation:** Create new minimal test cases to validate planning logic
