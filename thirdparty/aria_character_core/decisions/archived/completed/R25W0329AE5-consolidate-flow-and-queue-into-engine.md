# R25W0329AE5: Consolidate Flow and Queue into Engine

<!-- @adr_serial R25W0329AE5 -->

## Status

**ARCHIVED** - Moved to `decisions/archived/completed/` (July 16, 2025)

## Tombstone Summary

**Original Status:** Completed (June 22, 2025)

**What Was Accomplished:**
- Achieved consolidation goal through single application architecture
- Confirmed no separate aria_flow or aria_queue applications existed
- Verified integrated Flow processing within aria_engine modules
- Documented actual architecture vs original assumptions
- Eliminated architectural fragmentation concerns

**Archive Reason:** Work successfully completed - consolidation goal achieved through existing unified architecture.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Single `aria_character_core` application structure confirmed
- External Flow dependency (`{:flow, "~> 1.2"}`) properly utilized
- Flow-based parallel processing integrated within aria_engine modules
- Reduced complexity through unified codebase
- All success criteria met with current architecture
