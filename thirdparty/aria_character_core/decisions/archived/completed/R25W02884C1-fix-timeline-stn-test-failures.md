# TOMBSTONE: Fix Timeline STN Test Failures

**Status:** Completed and Archived  
**Original Date:** June 24, 2025  
**Completion Date:** June 24, 2025  
**Archived Date:** June 28, 2025  
**Archive Location:** `decisions/archived/completed/`

## Summary

Successfully resolved 28 Timeline STN test failures across three main categories: missing MiniZincSolver module, API return type inconsistencies, and bridge validation issues. All LOD test failures (13/13) were also resolved with proper error handling for unsatisfiable temporal constraints.

## Archive Reason

**Completed ADR:** Work successfully finished, all success criteria met, no longer requires active tracking.

## Historical Context

This ADR addressed critical test failures in the Timeline STN (Simple Temporal Network) system. The work involved:

- **Missing MiniZincSolver Module**: Created and implemented proper integration with AriaMinizincStn
- **API Mismatches**: Standardized return types to consistent `{:ok, result}` tuple format
- **Bridge Validation**: Fixed bridge creation logic for semantic bridges with missing intervals
- **LOD System**: Implemented missing functions (`rescale_lod/2`, `convert_units/2`) and comprehensive error handling

## Key Achievements

- ✅ All 28 STN test failures resolved
- ✅ All 13 LOD test failures resolved  
- ✅ Proper `{:error, :unsatisfiable}` handling implemented
- ✅ API consistency achieved across STN operations
- ✅ Bridge validation working with converted intervals
