# R25W0667494: Integrate CP-SAT Solver Strategy via Exhort OR-Tools

<!-- @adr_serial R25W0667494 -->

**Status:** Proposed  
**Date:** June 20, 2025  
**Priority:** HIGH  

## Context

### Current Limitations

The existing OmniStrategy in aria_engine has significant limitations in solving complex optimization problems:

- **Limited Problem Coverage**: Can only solve ~15% of MiniZinc 2024 competition problems
- **No Constraint Programming**: Cannot handle global constraints like `alldifferent`, `cumulative`, `regular`
- **No Integer Programming**: Lacks linear and mixed-integer programming capabilities
- **No Specialized Algorithms**: Missing algorithms for TSP, VRP, scheduling, graph problems
- **Performance Gaps**: Custom implementations are 100x-1000x slower than specialized solvers

### Problem Analysis from MiniZinc 2024

Analysis of competition problems reveals major capability gaps:

**Cannot Currently Solve:**

- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Peaceable Queens, Train Scheduling, Vehicle Routing
- **Combinatorial Optimization**: Cable Tree Wiring, Community Detection, Network Optimization
- **Resource Scheduling**: Aircraft Disassembly, Concert Hall Capacity
- **Graph Problems**: Maximum clique, minimum vertex cover, shortest paths
- **Packing/Covering**: Bin packing, set cover, knapsack problems

### Exhort Library Overview

[Exhort](https://github.com/elixir-or-tools/exhort) provides Elixir bindings for Google OR-Tools, offering:

- **CP-SAT Solver**: State-of-the-art constraint programming solver
- **Linear Programming**: GLOP solver for LP problems
- **Mixed-Integer Programming**: Advanced MIP capabilities
- **Vehicle Routing**: Specialized VRP solver
- **Graph Algorithms**: Shortest path, max flow, min cost flow
- **Proven Performance**: World-class solver performance

## Decision

Integrate Exhort OR-Tools library into aria_engine's hybrid planning architecture by:

1. **Adding ExhortStrategy**: Create `HybridPlanner.Strategies.ORTools.ExhortStrategy`
2. **Insert into HybridCoordinatorV2**: Add ExhortStrategy as a 7th strategy alongside existing strategies
3. **Durative Actions Translation Layer**: Build translation from OR-Tools solutions to durative actions
4. **Unified Output Format**: Ensure all strategies produce durative action sequences (instant and durative)

**Key Architectural Principle**: ExhortStrategy becomes the 7th strategy in HybridCoordinatorV2 (alongside planning, temporal, state, domain, logging, execution), enabling the scheduler and other consumers to automatically benefit from CP-SAT optimization capabilities.

## Technical Architecture

### Unified Action Pipeline

```elixir
# Problem Input
Problem → HybridCoordinatorV2

# Strategy Selection and Execution
HybridCoordinatorV2 → [HTN/STN/StateV2/Domain/Logging/Execution/ExhortStrategy]

# Exhort Strategy Processing
ExhortStrategy → Builder.new() → Builder.build() → Model.solve() → SolverResponse

# Unified Output
SelectedStrategy → Actions[]

# Execution
Actions[] → Scheduler → Execution
```

### Exhort Solution Translation Design

**From Existing Strategies**:

```elixir
# HTN planning results → actions
HTNSolution → ActionConverter → [Action]

# STN temporal constraints → action timing
STNConstraints → TemporalMapper → Action.timing
```

**From Exhort Strategy**:

```elixir
# Exhort SAT solutions → actions
%SolverResponse{} → ExhortActionTranslator → [Action]

# Variable assignments → action sequences
SolverResponse.int_val(response, "var") → ActionSequenceBuilder → [Action]

# Boolean decisions → conditional actions
SolverResponse.bool_val(response, "decision") → ConditionalActionGenerator → [Action]
```

**Exhort API Integration**:

```elixir
# Generate variables using Enum.map/2
action_variables = 
  Enum.map(actions, fn action ->
    Expr.def_int_var("action_start_#{action.id}")
  end)

# Generate constraints using Enum.map/2
temporal_constraints =
  Enum.map(action_pairs, fn {a1, a2} ->
    Expr.new("action_start_#{a1.id}" < "action_start_#{a2.id}")
  end)
  |> List.flatten()

# Add to builder
Builder.new()
|> Builder.add(action_variables)
|> Builder.add(temporal_constraints)
|> Builder.build()
|> Model.solve()
```

### Solver Selection Strategy

**Problem Classification**:

- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Use ExhortStrategy with CP-SAT solver
- **Linear Optimization**: Use ExhortStrategy with GLOP solver
- **HTN Planning**: Use existing HybridCoordinatorV2 strategies
- **Domain Reasoning**: Use existing HybridCoordinatorV2 strategies
- **Mixed Problems**: Use collaborative approach with both

### Integration Points

**Within HybridCoordinatorV2**:

- Add ExhortStrategy as 7th strategy alongside HTN, STN, StateV2, Domain, Logging, and Execution
- Configure fallback chains: ExhortStrategy → HTNPlanningStrategy → MockStrategy
- Implement strategy selection based on problem type analysis within coordinator

**With Existing Systems**:

- Durative actions integration with scheduler and execution system
- Timeline integration for temporal constraint modeling
- StateV2 integration for state management during execution

## Success Criteria

### Problem Coverage Metrics

- **Target**: Solve 70-80% of MiniZinc 2024 competition problems (vs current 15%)
- **Constraint Problems**: Successfully solve Peaceable Queens, Train Scheduling
- **Optimization Problems**: Successfully solve Vehicle Routing, Network Optimization
- **Graph Problems**: Successfully solve shortest path and flow problems

### Performance Benchmarks

## Capability Analysis: Exhort vs OmniStrategy

### What Exhort/OR-Tools Excels At

- **Mathematical Optimization**: Linear programming, mixed-integer programming
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Global constraints, resource allocation, scheduling
- **Graph Problems**: Shortest path, max flow, network optimization
- **Combinatorial Problems**: TSP, VRP, bin packing, assignment problems
- **Performance**: 100x-1000x faster than custom implementations for these domains

### What Existing HybridCoordinatorV2 Strategies Excel At (Cannot be Replaced by Exhort)

- **HTN Planning**: Hierarchical task decomposition with domain methods
- **Domain Reasoning**: Action preconditions, effects, and semantic understanding
- **Execution Management**: Plan execution, monitoring, and reactive replanning
- **State Evolution**: Managing changing world state over time
- **Timeline Management**: Ongoing temporal reasoning and event coordination
- **Allen's Interval Algebra**: Native support for 13 interval relationships
- **Planning Paradigms**: Goal decomposition, method selection, task hierarchies

### Complementary Relationship

**Exhort Strategy Best For**:

- Resource allocation problems (crew scheduling, facility assignment)
- Optimization problems (shortest path, cost minimization)
- Constraint satisfaction (puzzle solving, configuration problems)
- Mathematical modeling problems

**Existing Strategies Best For**:

- Domain-specific planning (NPC behavior, story generation)
- Hierarchical task execution (complex multi-step procedures)
- Reactive planning (adapting to changing conditions)
- Semantic reasoning (understanding action meanings and effects)

### Unified Output: Durative Actions

**Critical Design Principle**: Both solver paths must produce the same output format:

```
Problem → [Existing HybridCoordinatorV2 OR ExhortStrategy] → Durative Actions → Scheduler → Execution
```

**Durative Actions Support**:

- **Instant Actions**: Duration = 0 (traditional planning actions)
- **Durative Actions**: Duration > 0 (temporal actions with start/end times)
- **Unified Interface**: Same execution path regardless of solver used

### Integration Strategy

Implement **ExhortStrategy as 7th Strategy**:

1. **Strategy Integration**: Add ExhortStrategy to HybridCoordinatorV2's strategy collection
2. **Strategy Selection**: HybridCoordinatorV2 selects ExhortStrategy for optimization problems
3. **Durative Actions Translation**: Convert all strategy outputs to durative action sequences
4. **Fallback Chains**: ExhortStrategy → HTNPlanningStrategy → MockStrategy within HybridCoordinatorV2
