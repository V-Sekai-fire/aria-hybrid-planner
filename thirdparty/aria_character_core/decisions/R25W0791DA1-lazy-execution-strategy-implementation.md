# R25W0791DA1: Lazy Execution Strategy Implementation

<!-- @adr_serial R25W0791DA1 -->

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** June 21, 2025  
**Priority:** HIGH

## Context

The `HybridPlanner.Strategies.Default.LazyExecutionStrategy` module currently has a TODO comment indicating the need to implement the `Plan.Core.run_lazy_refineahead/4` function. This function is critical for the lazy refinement execution model that the strategy is designed to encapsulate.

Currently, the `execute_plan/4` function falls back to `Plan.Core.plan/3` instead of using the intended lazy refinement approach:

```elixir
# TODO: Implement Plan.Core.run_lazy_refineahead/4 function  
Logger.warning(
  "LazyExecutionStrategy: Plan.Core.run_lazy_refineahead/4 not yet implemented"
)

case Plan.Core.plan(domain, initial_state, opts) do
```

This fallback doesn't provide the lazy refinement benefits that the strategy is supposed to deliver.

## Decision

Implement the `Plan.Core.run_lazy_refineahead/4` function to provide true lazy refinement execution capabilities:

1. Implement lazy plan refinement that executes actions incrementally
2. Support refinement-ahead strategies for better performance
3. Integrate with the existing Plan.Core architecture
4. Provide proper error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Plan.Core Function Implementation

- [ ] Implement `Plan.Core.run_lazy_refineahead/4` function signature
- [ ] Design lazy refinement algorithm that executes actions incrementally
- [ ] Implement refinement-ahead logic for performance optimization
- [ ] Add proper state management for incremental execution

### Phase 2: Lazy Execution Logic

- [ ] Implement step-by-step plan execution with refinement
- [ ] Add lookahead capabilities for better decision making
- [ ] Implement backtracking for failed execution paths
- [ ] Add execution context management for state tracking

### Phase 3: Integration with LazyExecutionStrategy

- [ ] Update `execute_plan/4` to use `run_lazy_refineahead/4`
- [ ] Remove fallback to `Plan.Core.plan/3`
- [ ] Update logging and error handling for lazy execution
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with existing strategy interface

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for lazy refinement execution
- [ ] Test performance improvements over standard planning
- [ ] Validate error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Test integration with hybrid coordinator

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `Plan.Core.run_lazy_refineahead/4` function is implemented and functional
- [ ] LazyExecutionStrategy uses lazy refinement instead of fallback planning
- [ ] Lazy execution provides performance benefits over standard execution
- [ ] All existing LazyExecutionStrategy tests continue to pass
- [ ] Error handling and recovery work correctly with lazy execution
- [ ] Integration with hybrid coordinator is seamless

## Consequences

**Benefits:**

- True lazy refinement execution capabilities
- Better performance through incremental plan execution
- Improved resource utilization with refinement-ahead strategies
- More responsive execution for large plans
- Better error recovery through incremental execution

**Risks:**

- Increased complexity in plan execution logic
- Potential for subtle bugs in lazy refinement algorithm
- Need for comprehensive testing of execution edge cases
- Possible performance overhead from refinement logic

## Implementation Strategy

### Lazy Refinement Algorithm

1. **Incremental Execution**: Execute plan actions one at a time with state updates
2. **Refinement Ahead**: Look ahead in the plan to optimize upcoming actions
3. **State Checkpointing**: Maintain execution checkpoints for rollback capability
4. **Dynamic Replanning**: Trigger replanning when execution fails or conditions change

### Function Signature

```elixir
@spec run_lazy_refineahead(Domain.t(), State.t(), Plan.t(), keyword()) ::
        {:ok, State.t()} | {:error, String.t()}
def run_lazy_refineahead(domain, initial_state, plan, opts \\ [])
```

### Integration Points

- Plan.Core module for core planning functionality
- LazyExecutionStrategy for strategy interface
- HybridCoordinatorV2 for coordinator integration
- StateV2 for state management
