<!-- @adr_serial R25W1257C0E -->

**Status:** Tombstoned  
**Date:** 2025-06-24  
**Superseded by:** R25W1298CE1

This ADR has been tombstoned and replaced by R25W1298CE1 (Hybrid Planner Complete Restoration and Standardization) which provides a more focused approach to the critical path dependency.

**Original content preserved in git history.**

## Replacement ADR

- **R25W1298CE1**: Hybrid Planner Complete Restoration and Standardization

## Context

The original comprehensive app restoration approach was too broad and unfocused. Analysis revealed that the hybrid planner is the critical path dependency for ARC Prize work, making a focused restoration approach more effective than attempting to fix all apps simultaneously.

**Key Insight:** Rather than comprehensive restoration across all apps, focus on the single critical dependency (hybrid planner) that blocks ARC Prize development.

**Timeline Impact:**

- Original: Comprehensive multi-app restoration (8-11 days)
- Revised: Focused hybrid planner restoration (14 days)
- Benefit: Clear scope, measurable success criteria, direct path to ARC readiness
