# R25W025F371: Replace Membrane with Flow for Parallel Processing

<!-- @adr_serial R25W025F371 -->

## Status

**ARCHIVED** - Moved to `decisions/archived/completed/` (July 16, 2025)

## Tombstone Summary

**Original Status:** Accepted (June 15, 2025)

**What Was Accomplished:**
- Successfully replaced Membrane workflows with Flow-based parallel processing
- Achieved dramatic performance improvement from 8% to >90% CPU utilization efficiency
- Eliminated coordination overhead from 91.9% to <5%
- Implemented Flow-based architecture for computational parallelism
- Brought implementation into compliance with R25W023C3DB specification

**Archive Reason:** Work successfully completed - Flow-based parallel processing implemented and performance targets achieved.

**Key Deliverables:**
- FlowWorkflow module with parallel action processing
- Flow-based constraint solving with multi-core scaling
- Performance improvements: 8-10x speedup on 12 cores vs previous 1.0x
- Proper separation: Flow for computation, Membrane for streaming
- Compliance with R25W023C3DB architecture requirements
