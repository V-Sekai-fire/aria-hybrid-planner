# R25W123C5BF: Recursive ADR Pause Implementation

<!-- @adr_serial R25W123C5BF -->

**Status:** Completed  
**Date:** June 24, 2025  
**Priority:** LOW

## Context

The project had accumulated 30 active ADRs across multiple directories that needed to be paused simultaneously. Manual updating of each ADR would be time-consuming and error-prone. A systematic approach was needed to efficiently pause all active ADRs while preserving their existing format and content.

## Decision

Implement a command-line based batch processing approach using standard Unix tools (find, grep, sed, xargs) to recursively identify and update all active ADRs across the project structure.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Discovery and Identification ✅

**Completed Tasks:**

- [x] Identify all ADR files across project structure using `find`
- [x] Filter out tombstone files to avoid processing archived ADRs
- [x] Use `grep` with `xargs` to find files containing "Status.*Active"
- [x] Create temporary file list for batch processing

**Commands Used:**

```bash
find . -name "*.md" -path "*/decisions/*" | grep -v tombstone | xargs grep -l "Status.*Active" > /tmp/active_adrs.txt
```

### Phase 2: Status Format Analysis ✅

**Completed Tasks:**

- [x] Analyze different status line formats across ADRs
- [x] Identify standard format: `**Status:** Active`
- [x] Identify bullet format: `Status: Active`
- [x] Account for existing paused ADRs: `**Status:** Active (Paused)`

**Discovery Results:**

- 30 total active ADRs found
- 2 already paused ADRs identified
- Multiple format variations requiring different sed patterns

### Phase 3: Batch Update Implementation ✅

**Completed Tasks:**

- [x] Apply sed pattern for standard format ADRs
- [x] Handle special case for bullet format ADR
- [x] Verify updates were applied correctly
- [x] Ensure no double-updating of already paused ADRs

**Commands Used:**

```bash
# Standard format update
sed -i 's/\*\*Status:\*\* Active$/\*\*Status:\*\* Active (Paused)/' $(cat /tmp/active_adrs.txt)

# Bullet format update
sed -i 's/Status: Active/Status: Active (Paused)/' ./decisions/117-temporal-planning-segment-closure.md
```

### Phase 4: Verification and Cleanup ✅

**Completed Tasks:**

- [x] Verify all 30 ADRs now show "Active (Paused)" status
- [x] Confirm no remaining unpaused active ADRs
- [x] Clean up temporary files
- [x] Document the process in this ADR

## Results

**Successfully Updated ADRs:**

- **11 ADRs** in `apps/aria_temporal_planner/decisions/`
- **1 ADR** in `apps/aria_minizinc/decisions/`
- **18 ADRs** in root `decisions/` directory

**Status Transformations:**

- `**Status:** Active` → `**Status:** Active (Paused)`
- `Status: Active` → `Status: Active (Paused)`
- Preserved existing dates and additional status information

## Technical Approach

### Command Line Tools Used

1. **find**: Recursive file discovery across directory structure
2. **grep**: Pattern matching for status identification
3. **sed**: Batch text replacement with regex patterns
4. **xargs**: Efficient batch processing of file lists
5. **wc**: Verification counting

### Key Advantages

- **Efficiency**: Processed 30 files in seconds vs manual editing
- **Consistency**: Uniform status format applied across all ADRs
- **Safety**: Preserved existing content and formatting
- **Verification**: Built-in checks to ensure complete coverage

### Pattern Matching Strategy

```bash
# Find all ADR files (excluding tombstones)
find . -name "*.md" -path "*/decisions/*" | grep -v tombstone

# Identify active ADRs
xargs grep -l "Status.*Active"

# Apply targeted updates
sed -i 's/\*\*Status:\*\* Active$/\*\*Status:\*\* Active (Paused)/'
```

## Success Criteria

- [x] All 30 active ADRs successfully paused
- [x] No remaining unpaused active ADRs in project
- [x] Existing ADR format and content preserved
- [x] Process documented for future reference
- [x] Verification completed with command-line tools

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- All active ADRs now clearly marked as paused
- Efficient batch processing approach established
- Reusable methodology for future ADR management
- Preserved complete ADR history and context
- Demonstrated effective use of command-line tools over manual processes

**Negative:**

- Requires understanding of Unix command-line tools
- Sed regex patterns need careful testing for different formats
- Temporary files needed for complex batch operations

## Lessons Learned

1. **Command-line tools are highly effective** for batch text processing tasks
2. **Pattern analysis is crucial** before applying batch updates
3. **Verification steps are essential** to ensure complete coverage
4. **Multiple format handling** requires different sed patterns
5. **Temporary files** provide safety for complex batch operations
