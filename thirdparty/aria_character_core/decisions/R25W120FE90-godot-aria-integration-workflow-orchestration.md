# R25W120FE90: Godot-Aria Integration and Workflow Orchestration

<!-- @adr_serial R25W120FE90 -->

**Status:** Active (Paused)  
**Date:** June 24, 2025  
**Priority:** MEDIUM

## Context

With R25W118994A providing libgodot integration and R25W119A759 providing MCP server capabilities, we need to integrate Godot Engine with the broader Aria ecosystem. This includes connecting Godot with AriaEngine temporal planner, Aria scheduler, and the existing membrane pipeline infrastructure.

Key requirements:

- Bidirectional integration between Godot and AriaEngine planner
- Game state synchronization with Aria scheduler
- Scene generation from temporal planning results
- Integration with existing membrane pipeline workflows
- Real-time game state updates based on planning decisions

## Decision

Create a comprehensive integration layer that connects Godot Engine with Aria's temporal planning, scheduling, and workflow systems, enabling AI-driven game development and dynamic content generation.

### Architecture Components

1. **Integration App**: `aria_godot_integration`
2. **Planning Bridge**: Connect AriaEngine planner with Godot scenes
3. **Scheduler Sync**: Synchronize game events with Aria scheduler
4. **Membrane Pipeline**: Process game content through existing workflows
5. **State Management**: Maintain consistency between systems
