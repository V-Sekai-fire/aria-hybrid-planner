# R25W0143F62: Implementation Risk Mitigation

<!-- @adr_serial R25W0143F62 -->

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The temporal planner is critical to the entire game concept viability. If precise temporal planning cannot be implemented reliably, the core gameplay concept fails entirely.

## Decision

Accept that temporal planner success is critical to game viability, and implement comprehensive risk mitigation through fallback strategies.

## Rationale

- **Fundamental Dependency**: The "Conviction in Crisis" game concept requires reliable temporal planning
- **Implementation Paradox**: Cannot estimate timing without implementation, cannot plan without estimation
- **Game Design Brittleness**: All core features depend on predictable action timing
- **Success-Critical**: Without working temporal planner, there is no viable game

## Implementation Risk Analysis

### Critical Success Dependencies

- **Precise Duration Estimates**: "Moving from A to B takes 3.2 seconds"
- **Reliable Completion Prediction**: "Action will complete at 14:32:15.432"
- **Interruptible Progress Tracking**: "Currently 60% through movement"
- **Real-time ETA Updates**: "Arrival in 1.8 seconds... 1.7... 1.6..."

### Failure Modes Without Working Implementation

- **Arbitrary Timing**: Made-up durations that don't match reality
- **Inconsistent Experience**: Actions take random amounts of time
- **Broken Interruption**: Can't interrupt actions reliably
- **No Player Agency**: Unpredictable timing eliminates meaningful decisions
- **Undemonstrable**: Cannot show working game to others

### Implementation-Estimation Paradox

- **Cannot Estimate Without Implementation**: Time estimation requires working code to measure
- **Cannot Plan Without Estimation**: Game design requires known action durations
- **Cannot Test Without Planning**: Validation requires predictable timing
- **Circular Dependency**: Each element depends on the others working

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Primary Approach

- **Start with MVP**: Simplest possible working temporal planner
- **Measure Everything**: Instrument all action durations and progress tracking
- **Test Thoroughly**: Automated tests for timing reliability and interruption
- **Fail Fast**: If basic temporal planning doesn't work, pivot immediately

### Fallback Options (Priority Order)

1. **Simplified Timing**: Use integer seconds instead of sub-second precision
2. **Turn-Based Mode**: Convert to discrete turn system if real-time fails
3. **No-Interruption Mode**: Remove interruption mechanics if timing proves unreliable
4. **Pure Demonstration**: Focus on showing planning concepts rather than real-time gameplay

### Success Criteria for Game Viability

- **Deterministic Action Duration**: Same action always takes same time
- **Sub-second Precision**: Timing accurate to 100ms or better
- **Reliable Interruption**: SPACEBAR always stops action cleanly
- **Accurate Progress Display**: Visual progress matches actual completion
- **Consistent Replanning**: Interrupted actions resume from correct position

## Implementation-First Approach

### Measure Real Performance

- **Actual Execution Time**: Use real code execution time for estimates
- **Reality-Based Iteration**: Adjust game design to match implementation capabilities
- **Validation Through Testing**: Prove timing reliability through automated tests
- **Demonstration Confidence**: Working code enables convincing demonstrations

### Critical Insight

The temporal planner is not just a feature - it's the foundational technology that makes the entire game concept possible.
Success or failure of the temporal planner determines the viability of the entire project.

## Contingency Planning

### If Temporal Planning Succeeds

- **Full Implementation**: Continue with complete feature set
- **Enhanced Features**: Add advanced timing-dependent mechanics
- **Professional Polish**: Focus on user experience improvements
- **Demonstration Ready**: Showcase full system capabilities

### If Temporal Planning Fails

- **Immediate Pivot**: Abandon real-time temporal planning
- **Alternative Concepts**: Explore turn-based or simplified timing models
- **Lessons Learned**: Document why temporal planning failed
- **Future Research**: Identify what would be needed for future attempts

## Success Validation

### Minimum Viable Temporal Planning

- **Basic Timing**: Actions execute at predictable times
- **Simple Interruption**: Can stop actions cleanly
- **State Consistency**: System maintains coherent state during changes
- **Demonstrable Progress**: Clear evidence of temporal planning working

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear recognition of project-critical dependency
- Comprehensive fallback strategies reduce total project risk
- Focus on essential temporal planning capabilities
- Reality-based approach ensures practical solutions

### Negative

- High pressure on temporal planning implementation
- Limited alternatives if core approach fails
- May require significant scope reduction if timing fails
- Success or failure determined by single critical component
