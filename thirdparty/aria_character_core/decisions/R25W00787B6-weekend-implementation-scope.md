# R25W00787B6: Friday-Sunday Implementation Scope

<!-- @adr_serial R25W00787B6 -->

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The temporal planner implementation must be scoped appropriately for a weekend timeline, balancing ambition with achievability while ensuring a demonstrable working system.

## Decision

Prioritize core temporal planner functionality over polish features for weekend timeline.

## Rationale

- **Realistic Timeline**: Weekend implementation requires careful feature prioritization
- **Demonstrable Core**: Focus on essential functionality that proves the concept
- **Incremental Enhancement**: Design for post-weekend expansion without rewriting
- **Risk Management**: Ensure working demonstration even if advanced features aren't completed

## Implementation

### MUST HAVE (Core MVP)

- **Architecture**: Basic temporal state architecture and data structures
- **Scheduling**: Simple Oban job scheduling and execution
- **Test Scenario**: Minimal TimeStrike scenario (fixed map, 2 agents, 1 enemy)
- **Interface**: Basic CLI with real-time display (no fancy animations)
- **Validation**: Core stability verification (simplified Lyapunov functions)
- **Input**: Essential player input (SPACEBAR interrupt, basic hotkeys)

### SHOULD HAVE (If Time Permits)

- **Full Scenario**: Complete TimeStrike scenario with all agents and enemies
- **Polish**: Refined CLI with smooth animations and visual effects
- **Mechanics**: Complete opportunity window mechanics with timing challenges
- **Robustness**: Comprehensive error handling and edge cases
- **Performance**: Optimization for 1000 FPS target

### COULD HAVE (Post-Weekend)

- **Streaming Features**: Advanced streaming features (chat integration framework)
- **Dynamics**: Complex environmental dynamics and fog of war
- **AI Adaptation**: Sophisticated AI adaptation and pattern recognition
- **Complexity**: Multi-level maps and terrain complexity
- **Documentation**: Extensive testing and documentation

### WON'T HAVE (Future Versions)

- **Graphics**: 3D graphics or complex visual effects
- **Multiplayer**: Multiplayer support
- **Persistence**: Save/load game functionality
- **Audio**: Advanced audio system
- **Deployment**: Mobile or web deployment

## Implementation Strategy

- **Friday**: Core temporal planner architecture and basic Oban integration
- **Saturday**: TimeStrike game logic and basic CLI interface
- **Sunday**: Player input system and opportunity mechanics integration
- **Buffer Time**: Use simplified implementations that can be enhanced post-weekend

## Consequences

### Positive

- Realistic scope management for weekend timeline
- Clear priorities prevent feature creep
- Demonstrable system guaranteed
- Foundation for future expansion

### Negative

- Limited feature set may not fully showcase system capabilities
- May require post-weekend work for compelling demonstrations
- Trade-offs between functionality and polish
- Risk of over-simplification
