# R25W0298C62: Aria Engine Functional Implementation

<!-- @adr_serial R25W0298C62 -->

## Status

Paused (Started: June 15, 2025, Paused: June 15, 2025)  
**Priority**: Critical - foundational system implementation  
**Paused Reason**: Prerequisite aria_flow functionality needs to be implemented first

## Context

The aria_engine is a core component that needs to be fully functional to support the aria_timestrike application and broader system functionality. Currently, the engine has implementation gaps that prevent basic operations from working correctly.

This ADR focuses specifically on implementing the core aria_engine functionality required to make the system operational, extracted from ADR-058 to provide focused implementation scope.

### Current State Analysis

Based on initial assessment, the aria_engine requires:

1. **Core Engine Module**: Basic engine initialization and state management
2. **Action System**: Mechanism for processing and validating actions
3. **Position Management**: Handling of coordinate systems and position validation
4. **Integration Interfaces**: APIs for aria_timestrike and other components to interact with the engine

### Root Cause

The aria_engine appears to be missing fundamental implementation that other components depend on. This is blocking progress on aria_timestrike tests and overall system functionality.

## Decision

Implement the aria_engine as a focused, minimal but functional system that provides:

1. **Core engine functionality** that can be started and managed
2. **Action processing system** that validates and executes basic actions
3. **Position management** that handles coordinate validation and conversion
4. **Clean API surface** for integration with other components

### Implementation Philosophy

- **Minimal viable implementation**: Focus on core functionality needed by current dependents
- **Test-driven approach**: Implement functionality guided by failing tests in aria_timestrike
- **Clean interfaces**: Provide clear APIs that other components can depend on
- **Incremental enhancement**: Build foundation that can be extended as needed

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Engine Structure

- [ ] Create basic AriaEngine module with start/stop functionality
- [ ] Implement engine state management (started, stopped, error states)
- [ ] Add basic configuration handling
- [ ] Create integration tests for engine lifecycle

### Phase 2: Action System

- [ ] Define action structure and validation
- [ ] Implement action processing pipeline
- [ ] Add action result handling and error reporting
- [ ] Create tests for basic action processing

### Phase 3: Position Management

- [ ] Implement coordinate system handling
- [ ] Add position validation and conversion functions
- [ ] Handle position format errors and edge cases
- [ ] Test position operations with various input formats

### Phase 4: Integration Support

- [ ] Create API functions for aria_timestrike integration
- [ ] Implement callback/event system for action results
- [ ] Add performance monitoring hooks for benchmarking
- [ ] Ensure clean shutdown and resource cleanup

### Phase 5: Validation and Testing

- [ ] Run aria_timestrike BaselineTest suite against implementation
- [ ] Fix any remaining integration issues
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit test coverage
- [ ] Performance validation and optimization if needed

## Success Criteria

1. **aria_timestrike BaselineTest passes**: All 4 failing tests in aria_timestrike pass
2. **Clean API surface**: Other components can easily integrate with aria_engine
3. **Reliable operation**: Engine starts, processes actions, and shuts down cleanly
4. **Performance baseline**: Engine meets basic performance requirements for timestrike usage
5. **Test coverage**: Core functionality has comprehensive test coverage

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Unblocks aria_timestrike development**: Tests can pass and development can continue
- **Provides stable foundation**: Other components have reliable engine to build on
- **Clear architecture**: Well-defined interfaces between engine and consumers
- **Testable system**: Comprehensive test suite ensures reliability

### Risks

- **Scope creep**: Need to resist adding features beyond core requirements
- **Performance concerns**: Initial implementation may need optimization later
- **API stability**: Changes to engine APIs may require updates to dependents

## Related ADRs

- **ADR-058**: Aria Timestrike Baseline Test Failures (paused - extracted from this ADR)
- **R25W0031F1C**: Game Engine Separation
- **ADR-006**: Game Engine Real-Time Execution

## Notes

This ADR extracts the aria_engine implementation work from ADR-058 to provide focused scope and clear completion criteria. The goal is to create a functional engine that supports current needs while providing a foundation for future enhancement.
