# R25W026F0B7: Todo Encapsulation

<!-- @adr_serial R25W026F0B7 -->

## Status

**ARCHIVED** - Moved to `decisions/archived/obsolete/` (July 16, 2025)

## Tombstone Summary

**Original Status:** Active (minimal content)

**Why Obsolete:**
- Contained only minimal TODO items without substantial implementation plan
- API abstraction issues appear to have been addressed through other work
- Content was superseded by actual implementation and other ADRs
- No clear completion criteria or comprehensive scope defined

**Archive Reason:** ADR became obsolete due to minimal scope and superseding implementation work.

**Original Intent:**
- Remove GPU/hardware-specific terminology from public APIs
- Abstract away "backflow" terminology
- Hide "stages" concept from public API
- Make public API describe WHAT not HOW

**Current Reality:**
- API abstraction work handled through other architectural decisions
- Flow-based processing implemented with proper abstractions
- Public API design addressed in comprehensive ADRs
- Original concerns resolved through broader architectural work
