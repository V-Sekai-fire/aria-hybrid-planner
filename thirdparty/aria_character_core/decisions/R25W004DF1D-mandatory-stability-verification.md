# R25W004DF1D: Mandatory Stability Verification

<!-- @adr_serial R25W004DF1D -->

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2025-06-13

## Context

Stability verification ensures that temporal plans are viable and won't lead to system instability or infinite loops in the planning process.

## Decision

Always verify stability (not optional).

## Rationale

- Following the pattern of existing GTN implementations where goals are always verified
- Stability verification prevents system instability and infinite planning loops
- Core requirement for reliable temporal planning
- Ensures plan viability before execution

## Consequences

### Positive

- Guaranteed plan stability before execution
- Prevention of infinite loops and system instability
- Reliable temporal planning behavior
- Consistent with established GTN patterns

### Negative

- Additional computational overhead for verification
- Potential plan rejection requiring replanning

## Implementation Details

- Stability verification is a core requirement, not an optional optimization
- Every plan must pass stability checks before execution
- Use appropriate stability verification algorithms (e.g., Lyapunov functions)
- Failed stability checks trigger replanning process

## Related Decisions
