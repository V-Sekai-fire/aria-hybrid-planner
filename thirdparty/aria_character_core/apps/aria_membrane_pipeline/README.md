# AriaMembranePipeline

Pipeline processing system using Membrane Framework for streaming data transformation and validation.

## Overview

AriaMembranePipeline provides a comprehensive pipeline processing layer built on the Membrane Framework. It handles streaming data transformation, validation, and coordination between different components of the Aria system.

## Core Components

- **Pipeline Management** - Orchestrates complex data processing workflows
- **Format Transformation** - Converts between different data formats and representations
- **Validation Pipelines** - Ensures data integrity and constraint satisfaction
- **MCP Integration** - Provides Model Context Protocol source and sink capabilities
- **Solver Integration** - Interfaces with MinZinc and other constraint solvers

## Key Features

- **Streaming Processing** - Handles continuous data streams with backpressure management
- **Format Conversion** - Transforms between JSON, planning formats, and internal representations
- **Validation Layers** - Multi-stage validation with detailed error reporting
- **Solver Coordination** - Manages constraint solver execution and result processing
- **Testing Infrastructure** - Comprehensive testing filters and validation pipelines

## Dependencies

- **aria_engine_core** - Core state management and utilities
- **aria_hybrid_planner** - Planning strategy coordination
- **aria_temporal_planner** - Temporal reasoning capabilities
- **aria_scheduler** - Activity scheduling and resource management
- **membrane_core** - Membrane Framework foundation
- **membrane_file_plugin** - File I/O capabilities

## Usage

```elixir
# Create and start a pipeline
pipeline = AriaMembranePipeline.create_validation_pipeline(config)
AriaMembranePipeline.start_pipeline(pipeline)

# Process data through pipeline
result = AriaMembranePipeline.process_data(pipeline, input_data)
```

## Architecture

The pipeline system is organized into several layers:

1. **Source Layer** - Data ingestion from various sources
2. **Transformation Layer** - Format conversion and data manipulation
3. **Validation Layer** - Constraint checking and integrity verification
4. **Processing Layer** - Core business logic and solver integration
5. **Sink Layer** - Output formatting and delivery

Each layer is implemented as Membrane filters that can be composed into complex processing workflows.
