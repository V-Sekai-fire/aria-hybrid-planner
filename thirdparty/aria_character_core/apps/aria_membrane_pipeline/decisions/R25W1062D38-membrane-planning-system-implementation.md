# R25W1062D38: Membrane Planning System Implementation

<!-- @adr_serial R25W1062D38 -->

**Status:** Completed  
**Date:** 2025-06-22  
**Completion Date:** 2025-06-22  
**Priority:** HIGH

## Context

The existing planning system was fragmented across multiple approaches (HybridCoordinatorV2, direct MiniZinc calls, etc.) without a unified interface or proper asynchronous execution. This ADR implements a complete membrane-based planning system that consolidates all strategies under a single, extensible architecture.

## Decision

Implement a unified membrane planning system with the following components:

### Core Architecture

1. **PlannerBin** - Main orchestration bin that coordinates all planning strategies
2. **StrategyRouterFilter** - Intelligent routing based on problem characteristics and user preferences
3. **Strategy Filters** - Individual filters for each planning strategy (HybridCoordinator, MiniZinc, etc.)
4. **Unified Formats** - Standardized request/response formats following R25W0923F7E

### Key Features

- **Asynchronous Execution** - All planning operations run asynchronously with timeout handling
- **Strategy Fallback** - Automatic fallback to alternative strategies when primary fails
- **Performance Monitoring** - Comprehensive metrics collection and reporting
- **Unified Goal Format** - Standardized {subject, predicate, value} goal specification
- **Entity+Capability Model** - Consistent entity requirements following R25W0923F7E

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Update existing planning interfaces to use membrane system
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite (15 tests passing)
- [x] Performance benchmarking and optimization
- [x] Documentation and examples

## Technical Specifications

### Unified Goal Format (R25W0923F7E Compliance)

```elixir
# Goals follow subject-first format
goals = [
  {"player", "location", "room1"},
  {"chef", "task", "cooking"},
  {"oven", "temperature", 350}
]
```

### Action Specification

```elixir
# Actions use entity+capability model
Domain.add_action(:cook_meal, &cook_meal/2, %{
  duration: "PT2H",  # ISO 8601 duration
  requires_entities: [
    %{type: "agent", capabilities: [:cooking]},
    %{type: "oven", capabilities: [:heating]},
    %{type: "ingredients", capabilities: [:consumable]}
  ],
  description: "Prepare a meal using cooking equipment"
})
```

### Strategy Selection Logic

1. **User Preferences** - Honor explicit strategy preferences when valid
2. **Problem Analysis** - Route based on complexity, temporal constraints, goal count
3. **Strategy Validation** - Ensure selected strategy can handle problem characteristics
4. **Fallback Chain** - Automatic fallback to alternative strategies

### Performance Monitoring

- **Execution Time Tracking** - Per-strategy and overall execution metrics
- **Success/Failure Rates** - Strategy reliability statistics
- **Fallback Frequency** - Monitoring of fallback trigger patterns
- **Resource Usage** - Memory and CPU utilization tracking

## Benefits

### Unified Interface

- Single entry point for all planning operations
- Consistent request/response formats across strategies
- Simplified integration for client code

### Improved Reliability

- Automatic fallback handling reduces single points of failure
- Timeout protection prevents hanging operations
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

### Better Performance

- Asynchronous execution enables concurrent operations
- Strategy selection optimization based on problem characteristics
- Performance monitoring enables continuous improvement

### Enhanced Maintainability

- Clear separation of concerns between strategies
- Standardized interfaces reduce coupling
- Extensible architecture for adding new strategies

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Unified Planning Interface** - Single, consistent API for all planning operations
- **Improved Reliability** - Fallback handling and timeout protection
- **Better Performance Monitoring** - Comprehensive metrics and statistics
- **Extensible Architecture** - Easy to add new strategies and features
- **R25W0923F7E Compliance** - Follows unified action specification standards

### Negative

- **Increased Complexity** - More components to understand and maintain
- **Migration Effort** - Existing code needs updates to use new interface
- **Memory Overhead** - Additional processes and message passing

### Risks

- **Performance Impact** - Message passing overhead vs direct function calls
- **Debugging Complexity** - Distributed execution makes debugging more challenging
- **Compatibility Issues** - Existing strategies may need adaptation

## Monitoring and Success Criteria

### Performance Metrics

- **Strategy Selection Accuracy** - Percentage of optimal strategy selections
- **Execution Time Improvement** - Comparison with direct strategy calls
- **Fallback Success Rate** - Percentage of successful fallback operations
- **Overall System Reliability** - Reduction in planning failures

### Success Criteria

- All existing planning functionality works through membrane system
- Performance within 10% of direct strategy calls
- Fallback success rate > 90%
- Zero data loss during strategy transitions
