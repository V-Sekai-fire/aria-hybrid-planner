## Progress Notes

### STN Level of Detail (LOD) System Design

### Concept Overview

An STN LOD system would provide different levels of temporal precision based on the query context and distance from the current time. This is similar to how 3D graphics use LOD to reduce polygon count for distant objects.

### Proposed LOD Levels

1. **Ultra-High Resolution (1ms ticks)**: Current game time ±5 seconds
2. **High Resolution (10ms ticks)**: Current game time ±1 minute  
3. **Medium Resolution (100ms ticks)**: Current game time ±10 minutes
4. **Low Resolution (1s ticks)**: Current game time ±1 hour
5. **Very Low Resolution (10s ticks)**: Beyond ±1 hour

### Key Benefits

- **Reduced Complexity**: O(n³) PC-2 operates on fewer time points at lower resolutions
- **Memory Efficiency**: Less constraint storage for distant/irrelevant time periods
- **Query Performance**: Fast approximate answers for broad temporal queries
- **Real-time Friendly**: Maintains 1ms precision only where needed for game engine

### Implementation Challenges

- **Precision Loss**: Must ensure critical constraints aren't lost in aggregation
- **Boundary Handling**: Smooth transitions between LOD levels
- **Constraint Propagation**: Changes at high resolution must propagate to lower levels
- **Query Complexity**: Need to determine appropriate LOD for each query
- **⚠️ CRITICAL: Interval Bounding Problem**: The most significant challenge

### The Interval Bounding Problem

**Core Issue**: If coarse-level constraint bounds are:

- **Too loose**: Never converge to consistent solution (infinite search space)
- **Too tight**: Eliminate valid solutions (false inconsistency reports)
- **Misaligned**: Refinement process can't find the actual solution

**Mathematical Challenge**:

- Coarse bounds must be **conservative approximations** of fine bounds
- Must preserve **solution space inclusion**: `Fine_Solutions ⊆ Coarse_Solutions`
- Refinement must **monotonically tighten** bounds without losing consistency
- Need **convergence guarantees** or the LOD system becomes unreliable

### Interval Bounding Strategies

### Conservative Bound Inflation

```elixir
# Start with computed bounds, then inflate by safety margin
def coarsen_constraint({min_bound, max_bound}, safety_factor) do
  range = max_bound - min_bound
  margin = range * safety_factor  # e.g., 0.2 for 20% margin
  {min_bound - margin, max_bound + margin}
end
```

### Hierarchical Bound Propagation

```elixir
# Propagate bounds up hierarchy, maintaining inclusion property
def propagate_bounds_up(child_intervals, overlap_buffer) do
  min_bound = Enum.min(child_intervals, &(&1.min_bound)) - overlap_buffer
  max_bound = Enum.max(child_intervals, &(&1.max_bound)) + overlap_buffer
  {min_bound, max_bound}
end
```

### Constraint Strength Relaxation

```elixir
# Weaken constraint strength at coarse levels
def relax_allen_constraint(:before, relaxation_ms) do
  # "before" becomes "before with up to relaxation_ms overlap allowed"
  {:before_relaxed, max_overlap: relaxation_ms}
end
```

### Convergence Assurance

**Bound Inclusion Property**:

```
Solution_Space_Fine ⊆ Solution_Space_Medium ⊆ Solution_Space_Coarse
```

**Progressive Refinement Test**:

```elixir
def verify_refinement_validity(coarse_stn, fine_stn) do
  # Every solution in fine_stn must be valid in coarse_stn
  fine_stn |> STN.all_solutions() |> Enum.all?(&STN.validates?(&1, coarse_stn))
end
```

**Backtracking Strategy**:

- If fine level reports inconsistency → check if coarse bounds were too tight
- If medium level inconsistent → increase coarse safety margins
- If no consistent solution found → problem is genuinely unsolvable

### Technical Approach

The system would use hierarchical STN structures where:

- Each LOD level maintains its own constraint graph
- Constraints are automatically aggregated/downsampled to lower resolutions
- Queries select appropriate LOD based on temporal distance and required precision
- Critical constraints (user-defined) always maintain full precision

### Integration with PC-2

- Run PC-2 at each LOD level independently
- Use parallel processing for LOD levels that don't interact
- Implement incremental updates when high-res changes affect low-res constraints
- Cache solved constraint graphs per LOD level

## Time Conversion Strategy Design (June 15, 2025)

**Problem**: The system needs to accept time input in seconds (user-friendly) but solve at 1ms tick precision (performance-optimal) to meet the 1000 FPS requirement from ADR-006.

**Strategy Components**:

### Dual Time Representation

- **External API**: Accept time in floating-point seconds (e.g., 1.5s, 0.25s)
- **Internal Processing**: Convert to integer milliseconds (1500ms, 250ms) for STN solving
- **Time Origin**: Use `System.system_time(:millisecond)` as canonical start time (per ADR-070)

### Conversion Functions

```elixir
defmodule AriaEngine.Timeline.TimeConversion do
  @spec seconds_to_ticks(float()) :: integer()
  def seconds_to_ticks(seconds), do: trunc(seconds * 1000)
  
  @spec ticks_to_seconds(integer()) :: float()
  def ticks_to_seconds(ticks), do: ticks / 1000.0
  
  @spec validate_precision(float()) :: {:ok, integer()} | {:error, :precision_loss}
  def validate_precision(seconds) do
    ticks = seconds_to_ticks(seconds)
    reconstructed = ticks_to_seconds(ticks)
    if abs(reconstructed - seconds) < 0.0001 do
      {:ok, ticks}
    else
      {:error, :precision_loss}
    end
  end
end
```

### STN Matrix Operations at 1ms Precision

- PC-2 algorithm operates on integer millisecond bounds
- Floyd-Warshall shortest path calculations use integer arithmetic
- Constraint propagation maintains millisecond precision throughout

### API Design Pattern

```elixir
# User-facing API (seconds)
Timeline.add_interval(timeline, "action", start: 1.5, duration: 2.0)

# Internal storage (milliseconds)
%Interval{start_time: 1500, end_time: 3500, id: "action"}

# STN constraints (millisecond bounds)
%STNConstraint{from: :start, to: :action_start, min_bound: 1500, max_bound: 1500}
```

### Edge Case Handling

- **Sub-millisecond precision**: Round to nearest millisecond with validation warning
- **Large time values**: Handle up to 2^31 milliseconds (~24.8 days) per constraint
- **Floating-point errors**: Use epsilon comparison for time equality checks
- **Timeline synchronization**: Maintain consistent time reference across all operations

This strategy satisfies both the 1ms tick requirement from ADR-006 and user-friendly second-based input while ensuring no precision loss in temporal constraint solving.
