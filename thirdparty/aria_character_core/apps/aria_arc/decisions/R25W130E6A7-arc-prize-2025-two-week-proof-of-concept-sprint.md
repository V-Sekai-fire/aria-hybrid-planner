# R25W130E6A7: ARC Prize 2025 - Two-Week Proof of Concept Sprint

<!-- @adr_serial R25W130E6A7 -->

**Status:** Proposed  
**Date:** June 24, 2025  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Prerequisites:** R25W1298CE1 (Hybrid Planner Restoration) must be completed first

## The Two-Week Challenge Pitch

**The ARC Prize 2025 offers $1,000,000 for solving abstract reasoning puzzles - one of AI's grand challenges where current best non-human performance is stuck at 34% accuracy while human performance is at 100%.**

**Here's the deal: Give me two weeks to prove this is worth pursuing.**

### What We'll Build

**Week 1:** Computational search foundation - test 1000+ transformation programs per task, target 1-5% accuracy
**Week 2:** Add Aria's hybrid reasoning coordination, target 5-10% accuracy through planning integration

### Why This Works

**For Game Industry Perspective:** Low-risk validation sprint, portfolio expansion, competitive intelligence, network building
**For Technical Development:** Rapid AI engineering skills, architecture validation, clean research ethics, measurable outcomes

### The Unique Angle

Hybrid reasoning approach unlike pure neural networks - computational discovery coordinated through interpretable planning. Game development discipline meets AI research.

### Success Criteria

**Go/No-Go Decision:** 5%+ accuracy = proceed to full competition, <3% accuracy = valuable learning experience but stop there.

### Honest Assessment

**60% probability:** 2-5% accuracy, learn exactly where approach breaks down
**30% probability:** 5-10% accuracy, prove hybrid approach has merit  
**10% probability:** 10%+ accuracy, breakthrough potential

## Decision

**Proposed:** Two-week proof of concept sprint to validate ARC Prize approach after hybrid planner restoration is complete.

**The Question:** Would you rather spend two weeks finding out what we're actually capable of building, or always wonder if we could have achieved something remarkable?

## Prerequisites

**Critical Dependency:** R25W1298CE1 (Hybrid Planner Complete Restoration and Standardization) must be 100% complete before ARC work begins.

**Timeline:**

- **Weeks 1-2 (June 24 - July 8):** Hybrid planner restoration
- **Weeks 3-4 (July 8 - July 22):** ARC Prize proof of concept sprint

## Implementation Details

- **R25W131C16E**: Two-week sprint plan and detailed implementation
- **R25W1327B64**: Minimal viable technical architecture  
- **R25W133C875**: Risk analysis and business case details
