# R25W133C875: ARC Prize Risk Analysis

<!-- @adr_serial R25W133C875 -->

**Status:** Proposed  
**Date:** 2025-06-24  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Prerequisites:** R25W1298CE1 (Hybrid Planner Restoration) must be completed first

## Context

This ADR provides comprehensive risk analysis for the ARC Prize 2025 proof of concept sprint, incorporating lessons learned from git commit cadence analysis and historical project patterns.

**Evidence-Based Risk Assessment:**
Previous work shows 40+ planning commits with minimal implementation, indicating high risk of analysis paralysis and scope creep without strict controls.

## Risk Categories

### 1. Implementation Execution Risks

#### HIGH RISK: Analysis Paralysis

**Probability:** 70% (based on git commit history)  
**Impact:** Project failure through endless planning without implementation

**Evidence:**

- Historical pattern of extensive ADR creation with minimal code delivery
- 40+ planning commits observed with limited functional outcomes
- Tendency to expand architectural scope without proven necessity

**Mitigation:**

- **Implementation gates:** No architectural work without working code
- **Daily commit requirements:** Force regular implementation progress
- **Scope enforcement:** Strict 2-app limit with no exceptions
- **Timeline multipliers:** 3-5x estimates based on historical patterns

#### MEDIUM RISK: Scope Creep

**Probability:** 50%  
**Impact:** Timeline extension and complexity explosion

**Indicators:**

- Desire to add "just one more app" for completeness
- Architectural refactoring without proven necessity
- Feature additions beyond minimal viable implementation

**Mitigation:**

- **Forbidden expansions list:** Explicitly prohibited activities
- **2-app maximum:** No expansion beyond `aria_arc` + `aria_hybrid_planner`
- **Implementation gates:** Working code required before any scope changes

#### MEDIUM RISK: Hybrid Planner Dependency

**Probability:** 40%  
**Impact:** Complete project blockage if R25W1298CE1 fails

**Dependencies:**

- R25W1298CE1 must achieve 100% completion before ARC work begins
- Hybrid planner must pass all success criteria
- Integration testing must confirm functionality

**Mitigation:**

- **R25W1298CE1 completion gate:** Non-negotiable prerequisite
- **Fallback plan:** Pure computational approach if hybrid integration fails
- **Phase separation:** Phase 1 can succeed without hybrid planner

### 2. Technical Implementation Risks

#### HIGH RISK: Accuracy Targets Unachievable

**Probability:** 60%  
**Impact:** Go/no-go decision results in project termination

**Reality Check:**

- Current best ARC performance is 34% with sophisticated ML approaches
- Brute force computational search may achieve <1% accuracy
- Hybrid reasoning improvement may be minimal

**Mitigation:**

- **Realistic expectations:** 60% probability of 2-5% accuracy
- **Learning value:** Even failure provides valuable insights
- **Go/no-go criteria:** Clear decision points prevent sunk cost fallacy

#### MEDIUM RISK: Performance Bottlenecks

**Probability:** 50%  
**Impact:** Search evaluation too slow for practical use

**Technical Challenges:**

- 1000+ transformation programs per task may be computationally expensive
- Grid operations and comparison may not scale
- Elixir performance for computational tasks uncertain

**Mitigation:**

- **Performance targets:** <10 minutes per task evaluation
- **Optimization opportunities:** Parallel processing, early termination
- **Fallback approach:** Reduce search space if performance inadequate

#### LOW RISK: Integration Complexity

**Probability:** 30%  
**Impact:** Phase 2 hybrid reasoning integration fails

**Technical Factors:**

- R25W091EA37 standardization should simplify integration
- Hybrid planner restoration includes integration testing
- Phase 2 is conditional on Phase 1 success

**Mitigation:**

- **Phase separation:** Phase 1 success independent of integration
- **Integration testing:** Verify hybrid planner functionality first
- **Fallback option:** Pure computational approach remains viable

### 3. Timeline and Resource Risks

#### HIGH RISK: Timeline Underestimation

**Probability:** 80%  
**Impact:** Project extends beyond 2-week sprint commitment

**Historical Evidence:**

- Consistent pattern of underestimating implementation complexity
- Planning-to-implementation gap observed in git history
- Tendency to discover additional requirements during development

**Mitigation:**

- **Timeline multipliers:** 3-5x applied to initial estimates
- **Implementation gates:** Prevent work without proven foundations
- **Scope reduction:** Cut features rather than extend timeline

#### MEDIUM RISK: Resource Availability

**Probability:** 40%  
**Impact:** Insufficient development time for completion

**Factors:**

- 2-week sprint requires focused, uninterrupted development time
- Other project commitments may interfere
- Learning curve for ARC domain understanding

**Mitigation:**

- **Time blocking:** Dedicated development periods
- **Scope flexibility:** Reduce features to fit available time
- **Priority focus:** Critical path items first

### 4. Business and Strategic Risks

#### LOW RISK: Opportunity Cost

**Probability:** 30%  
**Impact:** Time spent on ARC could be used for other projects

**Considerations:**

- ARC Prize offers significant learning value regardless of outcome
- AI research skills development has long-term value
- Portfolio expansion into AI research domain

**Mitigation:**

- **Clear success criteria:** 5%+ accuracy for continuation
- **Learning documentation:** Capture insights regardless of outcome
- **Time-boxed commitment:** Strict 2-week limit

#### LOW RISK: Reputation Risk

**Probability:** 20%  
**Impact:** Public failure in AI research competition

**Factors:**

- Proof of concept sprint is internal evaluation
- No public commitments or announcements planned
- Learning-focused approach reduces reputation exposure

**Mitigation:**

- **Internal evaluation:** No external commitments
- **Learning focus:** Frame as research and development
- **Realistic expectations:** Acknowledge high difficulty

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Primary Controls

1. **Implementation Gates:** No architectural work without working code
2. **Scope Enforcement:** Strict 2-app limit with forbidden expansions
3. **Timeline Multipliers:** 3-5x estimates based on historical patterns
4. **Daily Commits:** Regular implementation progress tracking

### Secondary Controls

1. **Phase Separation:** Phase 1 success independent of Phase 2
2. **Fallback Plans:** Pure computational approach if hybrid integration fails
3. **Go/No-Go Criteria:** Clear decision points prevent sunk cost fallacy
4. **Learning Documentation:** Capture insights regardless of outcome

### Monitoring and Early Warning

**Daily Tracking:**

- Implementation progress (lines of code, working features)
- Scope adherence (app count, feature creep indicators)
- Timeline adherence (gate completion, milestone progress)

**Weekly Assessment:**

- Risk level changes based on progress
- Mitigation effectiveness evaluation
- Scope and timeline adjustments if needed

## Success Probability Assessment

### Phase 1 Success (Computational Search)

**Probability:** 70%

- **High confidence:** Basic ARC task loading and transformation
- **Medium confidence:** Search implementation and evaluation
- **Low confidence:** Achieving >1% accuracy target

### Phase 2 Success (Hybrid Reasoning)

**Probability:** 40% (conditional on Phase 1)

- **Medium confidence:** ARC domain integration
- **Low confidence:** Meaningful accuracy improvement
- **Very low confidence:** Achieving 5%+ accuracy

### Overall Project Success

**Probability:** 30% (5%+ accuracy)

- **Most likely outcome:** 2-5% accuracy, valuable learning
- **Optimistic outcome:** 5-10% accuracy, proceed to competition
- **Pessimistic outcome:** <1% accuracy, terminate after learning

## Risk Acceptance

**Acceptable Risks:**

- High probability of not achieving 5%+ accuracy target
- Potential timeline extension due to implementation complexity
- Learning-focused outcome rather than competitive success

**Unacceptable Risks:**

- Analysis paralysis preventing any implementation
- Scope creep beyond 2-app architecture
- Indefinite timeline extension without clear progress

## Conclusion

The ARC Prize proof of concept sprint carries significant implementation and technical risks, but with appropriate controls and realistic expectations, it offers valuable learning opportunities regardless of competitive outcome. The primary risk mitigation focus is preventing analysis paralysis through strict implementation gates and scope controls.

**Risk-Adjusted Recommendation:** Proceed with sprint after R25W1298CE1 completion, with clear understanding that success is measured by learning and implementation progress, not just accuracy targets.
