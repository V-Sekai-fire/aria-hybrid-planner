# R25W0503071: KHR Interactivity Systematic Verification Plan

<!-- @adr_serial R25W0503071 -->

**Status:** Obsolete - KHR System Deleted  
**Date:** June 18, 2025  
**Deletion Date:** June 18, 2025  
**Priority:** ~~HIGH~~ N/A

## Obsolescence Reason

This ADR is now obsolete as the entire KHR_interactivity system has been deleted from the project. The KHR node library, domain implementation, tests, and all related infrastructure have been removed. This ADR is preserved for historical reference only.

## Context

We have achieved ~95% implementation coverage of the KHR_interactivity specification based on comprehensive audit findings. The implementation includes 25 active modules with most core mathematical operations, control flow, events, and variable management complete. Final verification and completion requires focused work on remaining missing operations.

## Implementation Strategy

### Verification Approach

1. **Create test cases** based on KHR specification examples
2. **Compare implementations** against spec mathematical definitions
3. **Validate edge cases** including NaN, infinity, and overflow handling
4. **Check socket ordering** and activation semantics
5. **Verify configuration** processing and validation

### Missing Implementation Approach

1. **Study specification** requirements thoroughly
2. **Design interfaces** matching KHR node definitions
3. **Implement core logic** with proper error handling
4. **Add comprehensive tests** covering all scenarios
5. **Document implementation** decisions and trade-offs

### Current Focus: Specification Compliance Verification

**Immediate Priority:**

1. **Control Flow specification alignment** - verify against KHR spec requirements  
2. **Object Model Access implementation** - final missing piece for full compliance
3. **Animation Control verification** - ensure proper timeline mapping and state management
