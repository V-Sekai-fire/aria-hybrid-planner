defmodule AriaJoint.Transform.Tensor do
  @moduledoc """
  Tensor-based transform operations for Joint nodes using Nx.

  Provides batch operations for multiple joints, enabling efficient GPU-accelerated
  transform computations for animation and IK systems. This module complements
  the tuple-based AriaJoint.Transform with high-performance tensor operations.

  ## Features

  - Batch transform operations for multiple joints simultaneously
  - GPU-accelerated matrix computations via Nx
  - Efficient hierarchy propagation using tensor operations
  - Memory-optimized operations for large joint hierarchies
  - Seamless integration with AriaMath tensor functions

  ## Usage

      # Batch update multiple joint transforms
      joint_tensors = AriaJoint.Transform.Tensor.from_joints(joints)
      updated_tensors = AriaJoint.Transform.Tensor.apply_transforms_batch(joint_tensors, transforms)
      updated_joints = AriaJoint.Transform.Tensor.to_joints(updated_tensors, joints)

      # Batch coordinate space conversions
      global_points = AriaJoint.Transform.Tensor.to_global_batch(joints, local_points)
