# ADR: Nx Tensor Integration for aria_math, aria_joint, aria_gltf, and aria_qcp

**Status:** Completed  
**Date:** 2025-01-07  
**Completed:** 2025-01-07  
**Deciders:** Development Team

## Context

Four core mathematical apps in the umbrella project currently use manual tuple-based operations instead of leveraging their existing Nx dependencies for tensor operations:

- **aria_math**: Core mathematical operations (Vector3, Matrix4, Quaternion)
- **aria_joint**: Transform operations and hierarchy management  
- **aria_gltf**: Mesh processing and geometric transformations
- **aria_qcp**: Quaternion-based point cloud registration

While all apps have `:nx` dependencies, they're not utilizing Nx tensors for numerical computing, missing opportunities for performance optimization, GPU acceleration, and better interoperability.

## Decision

Migrate all four apps to use Nx tensors for their core mathematical operations while maintaining API compatibility through adapter layers.
