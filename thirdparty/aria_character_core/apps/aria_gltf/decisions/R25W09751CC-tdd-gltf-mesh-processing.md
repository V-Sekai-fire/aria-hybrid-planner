# R25W09751CC: TDD glTF Mesh Processing

<!-- @adr_serial R25W09751CC -->

**Status:** Paused  
**Date:** 2025-06-22  
**Paused:** 2025-06-22  
**Pause Reason:** GLTF work temporarily paused to focus on other priorities  
**Priority:** LOW  
**Extracted from:** R25W093B1C8 Phase 4

## Context

This ADR implements Phase 4 of the glTF Scene foundation using Test-Driven Development: Mesh and Primitive Processing. We need to develop utilities to translate raw glTF data into usable geometric representations, including vertex data retrieval, indexed geometry, morph targets, and skinning.

This phase depends on all previous phases and completes the glTF Scene foundation.

## Decision

Implement glTF mesh and primitive processing using strict Test-Driven Development, writing failing tests before any implementation code. Each component will be developed through Red-Green-Refactor cycles.

## TDD Implementation Plan

### 4.1 Vertex Data Retrieval (Red-Green-Refactor)

- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for POSITION attribute extraction
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for NORMAL attribute extraction
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for TEXCOORD_0 attribute extraction
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for missing attribute handling
- [ ] **GREEN**: Implement vertex data extraction
- [ ] **REFACTOR**: Clean up attribute processing

### 4.2 Indexed Geometry (Red-Green-Refactor)

- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for indices accessor processing
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for triangle assembly from indices
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for non-indexed primitive handling
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for index bounds validation
- [ ] **GREEN**: Implement indexed geometry support
- [ ] **REFACTOR**: Clean up indexing logic

### 4.3 Morph Targets (Red-Green-Refactor)

- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for morph target weight application
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for multiple morph targets
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for morph target attribute blending
- [ ] **GREEN**: Implement morph target processing
- [ ] **REFACTOR**: Clean up morphing implementation

### 4.4 Skinning Support (Red-Green-Refactor)

- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for joint and weight attribute processing
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for skin matrix calculation
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for vertex skinning transformation
- [ ] **GREEN**: Implement skinning logic
- [ ] **REFACTOR**: Clean up skinning implementation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Vertex data extraction handles all standard attributes
- [ ] Indexed geometry correctly assembles primitives
- [ ] Morph target processing applies weights correctly
- [ ] Skinning transformations work with joint hierarchies
- [ ] 100% test coverage achieved through TDD cycles
- [ ] All tests written before implementation (strict RED compliance)
- [ ] Performance optimized for large meshes
