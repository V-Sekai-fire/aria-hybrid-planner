# R25W0969BA8: TDD glTF Scene Graph Logic

<!-- @adr_serial R25W0969BA8 -->

**Status:** Paused  
**Date:** 2025-06-22  
**Paused:** 2025-06-22  
**Pause Reason:** GLTF work temporarily paused to focus on other priorities  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Extracted from:** R25W093B1C8 Phase 3

## Context

This ADR implements Phase 3 of the glTF Scene foundation using Test-Driven Development: Scene Graph Logic. We need to implement logic for interpreting and manipulating the scene hierarchy, including node transformations, global transformations, and scene traversal.

This phase depends on core data structures (R25W094A7AF) and data loading (R25W095BA8C), following strict TDD methodology.

## Decision

Implement glTF scene graph logic using strict Test-Driven Development, writing failing tests before any implementation code. Each component will be developed through Red-Green-Refactor cycles.

## TDD Implementation Plan

### 3.1 Node Transformations (Red-Green-Refactor)

- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for TRS to matrix conversion
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for matrix property usage (bypassing TRS)
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for identity transformation handling
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for transformation composition
- [ ] **GREEN**: Implement transformation logic to pass tests
- [ ] **REFACTOR**: Clean up transformation calculations

### 3.2 Global Transformations (Red-Green-Refactor)

- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for parent-child transformation chain
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for root node global transformation
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for deep hierarchy transformation
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for transformation caching
- [ ] **GREEN**: Implement global transformation logic
- [ ] **REFACTOR**: Clean up hierarchy traversal

### 3.3 Scene Traversal (Red-Green-Refactor)

- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for depth-first scene traversal
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for breadth-first scene traversal
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for node visitor pattern
- [ ] **RED**: Write failing test for traversal with transformation accumulation
- [ ] **GREEN**: Implement scene traversal mechanisms
- [ ] **REFACTOR**: Clean up traversal implementation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Node transformation logic correctly computes local matrices
- [ ] Global transformation computation handles parent hierarchy
- [ ] Scene traversal mechanisms support multiple patterns
- [ ] 100% test coverage achieved through TDD cycles
- [ ] All tests written before implementation (strict RED compliance)
- [ ] Performance optimizations for large scene graphs

## Dependencies

- **R25W094A7AF**: TDD glTF Core Data Structures (provides Node and Scene structs)
- **R25W095BA8C**: TDD glTF Data Loading & Parsing (provides loaded scene data)

## Blocks

- **R25W09751CC**: TDD Mesh Processing (depends on scene graph traversal)

- **R25W08877E1**: glTF Scene Foundation Implementation Plan (provides scope)
- **R25W087E1AE**: AriaEngine Plans glTF KHR Interactivity Implementation (overall planning)

## Implementation Status

**Status:** Waiting for R25W094A7AF and R25W095BA8C completion
**Next Step:** Begin 3.1 Node Transformations RED cycle after dependencies ready
**Timeline:** TDD approach with immediate feedback and incremental progress
