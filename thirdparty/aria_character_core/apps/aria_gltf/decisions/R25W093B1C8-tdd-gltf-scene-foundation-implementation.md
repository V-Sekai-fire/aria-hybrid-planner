# R25W093B1C8: TDD glTF Scene Foundation Implementation [TOMBSTONED]

<!-- @adr_serial R25W093B1C8 -->

**Status:** Tombstoned  
**Date:** 2025-06-22  
**Tombstoned:** 2025-06-22  
**Reason:** Extracted into focused phase-specific ADRs

## Tombstone Notice

This ADR has been **tombstoned** and its content extracted into four focused, phase-specific ADRs for better implementation tracking and TDD discipline.

## Extracted ADRs

The original R25W093B1C8 phases have been extracted into the following ADRs:

### Phase 1: Core Data Structures

**→ R25W094A7AF: TDD glTF Core Data Structures**

- Scene, Node, Mesh, Buffer, Material, and Texture structs
- Test-driven API design for all core glTF components
- Type safety validation through comprehensive tests

### Phase 2: Data Loading & Parsing  

**→ R25W095BA8C: TDD glTF Data Loading & Parsing**

- Gltf.Loader for .gltf/.glb files
- Binary data handling and AccessorView
- Comprehensive error handling for invalid data

### Phase 3: Scene Graph Logic

**→ R25W0969BA8: TDD glTF Scene Graph Logic**

- Node transformations and global transformation chains
- Scene traversal mechanisms (depth-first, breadth-first)
- Performance optimizations for large scene graphs

### Phase 4: Mesh Processing

**→ R25W09751CC: TDD glTF Mesh Processing**

- Vertex data retrieval and indexed geometry
- Morph targets and skinning support
- Performance optimization for large meshes

## Benefits of Extraction

**Focused Implementation:**

- Each ADR tackles one coherent phase with clear scope
- Better TDD discipline through smaller, manageable cycles
- Independent tracking and completion of each phase

**Clear Dependencies:**

- R25W094A7AF → R25W095BA8C → R25W0969BA8 → R25W09751CC
- Sequential implementation with well-defined prerequisites
- Prevents scope creep and maintains focus

**Enhanced Tracking:**

- Each phase can be completed and marked separately
- Progress visibility at granular level
- Better estimation and planning for each component

## Implementation Status

**Original R25W093B1C8:** Tombstoned (2025-06-22)
**Current Status:** Implementation continues in extracted ADRs
**Next Step:** Begin R25W094A7AF (Core Data Structures) TDD implementation

## Related ADRs

- **R25W08877E1**: glTF Scene Foundation Implementation Plan (provides overall scope)
- **R25W087E1AE**: AriaEngine Plans glTF KHR Interactivity Implementation (parent planning ADR)
- **R25W089FC2D**: Unified Durative Action Specification (provides planning foundation)

**Note:** This tombstone preserves the historical record while directing future work to the focused, phase-specific ADRs that enable better TDD implementation and tracking.
