# AriaAnimationDemo TODO

**@aria_serial:** R25W160DEMO

**ADR Reference:** R25W1398085 - Unified Durative Action Specification and Planner Standardization

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Umbrella Workflow Enforcement

**MANDATORY RULE: All Mix commands MUST be executed from umbrella root directory.**

### Verification Commands

Before running ANY Mix commands, verify your location:

```bash
pwd  # Should show /home/ernest.lee/Developer/aria-character-core (umbrella root)
ls   # Should show apps/ directory and root mix.exs
```

### FORBIDDEN Patterns ❌

```bash
# NEVER do these operations:
cd apps/aria_animation_demo && mix compile
cd apps/aria_timeline && mix test  
cd apps/any_app && mix deps.get
```

### REQUIRED Patterns ✅

```bash
# ALWAYS work from umbrella root:
mix compile                           # Compiles all apps in dependency order
mix test                             # Runs all tests across all apps
mix test apps/aria_animation_demo    # Tests specific app from root
mix deps.get                         # Manages dependencies for entire umbrella
mix deps.clean --all                 # Cleans all dependencies
```

## Overview

AriaAnimationDemo provides comprehensive demonstration of temporal animation coordination using forward kinematics with glTF animation data integrated with KHR Interactivity behavior graphs. This app serves as both a testing domain and reference implementation for temporal planning with character animation.

**Extracted from AriaEngineCore:** This demonstration functionality was moved from aria_engine_core to create a focused demo app that showcases temporal animation capabilities while keeping the core engine focused on planning infrastructure.

## App Responsibility

**Primary Domain:** Temporal Animation Coordination Demonstration

- **Forward Kinematics:** glTF animation data processing with joint hierarchy
- **Temporal Coordination:** Multi-animation sequencing and planning
- **Demo Scenarios:** Comprehensive test cases for animation planning
- **Integration Examples:** Real-world usage patterns for other apps

## Dependencies

**Tier 5 App** (high-level integration app with multiple dependencies):

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:aria_engine_core, in_umbrella: true},          # Core planning capabilities
    {:aria_khr_interactivity, in_umbrella: true},    # KHR functionality
    {:aria_gltf, in_umbrella: true},                 # glTF processing
    {:aria_timeline, in_umbrella: true},             # Timeline management
    {:aria_joint, in_umbrella: true},                # Joint hierarchy
    {:aria_math, in_umbrella: true},                 # Mathematical operations
    {:aria_state, in_umbrella: true}                 # State management
  ]
end
```
