## Quick Start

```bash
# Prerequisites: Elixir 1.18+, Erlang/OTP 26+, MiniZinc (required for alpha stage), cmake, and libgit2_1.8-devel
mix deps.get && mix compile
mix test  # All 382 tests passing

# Run scheduler demonstrations
mix schedule.samples  # Runs 3 core scheduling scenarios
```

## Core Capabilities

* **Hybrid HTN+STN Planning**: Combines goal decomposition with temporal constraints
* **Temporal Scheduling**: Resource and time management with ~~millisecond precision~~ (Replaced with configurable time units and LOD resolution v0.2.0)
* ~~**MCP Integration**~~ (Removed in v0.2.0): Schedule activities interface for external tool access

## Technical Overview

Aria Character Core is a research codebase for experimenting with AI planning, temporal scheduling, and NPC simulation. The project focuses on hybrid planning algorithms that combine Hierarchical Task Networks (HTN) with Simple Temporal Networks (STN) for intelligent agent behavior.

### Architecture Highlights

* **HybridCoordinatorV2**: Multi-strategy planning system with STN, ~~Optimizer~~ (Proposed in ADR-109, not implemented), and Default strategies
* **Timeline Module**: Complete temporal reasoning with Allen's Interval Algebra (IntervalRelations)
* **MiniZinc Integration**: Constraint programming for Simple Temporal Network solving
* **Strategy Pattern**: Extensible planning approaches for different problem types

### Research Focus

* **Temporal Constraint Solving**: Real-time scheduling with resource conflicts
* **Parallel Processing**: Multi-agent coordination using ~~Flow-based systems~~ (Removed v0.2.0)
* **Knowledge Representation**: RDF integration for decision-making; ~~SPARQL removed v0.2.0~~
* **Performance Scaling**: Algorithm validation from single to massive agent populations

## Scheduler Demonstrations

The project includes three core scheduling scenarios that demonstrate temporal planning capabilities:

1. **Sequential Scheduling**: Basic sequential activity planning with time constraints
2. **Resource Constraints**: Advanced scheduling with location conflicts, prop availability, and character limitations
3. **Entity Capabilities**: Character-specific scheduling based on individual abilities and restrictions

Each demonstration showcases different aspects of temporal planning and constraint solving capabilities.
